"I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment."
"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.

The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.

You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.

While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy."
"""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.

So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.

The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.

So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television."
"Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out and for good reason...it's terrific. Not all but most of the negative reviews are coming from either bots from competing streaming services, that rate everything that Netflix does bad, or from people who go out of their way to rate all the shows people like negatively. Some people just don't like it, which is fine, but there are people who are just miserable and like to troll. 99% of their reviews are negative. Who goes out of there way to comment on something they don't like? Personally, I only review shows I like. Obviously, Season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and it sucks that it's ending after next season."
"There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.

The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?

Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.

To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.

"Netflix has a bad rep for making insanely one-sided content -- that also goes with it's ""competitors"" with a social commentary message or a re-imagining of home media from a by-gone era. This is one of the only (if only) originals that is any reminiscent of the good ole' days (I'll even put Cobra Kai up there, why not :D)

The story is still going on, and it's always refreshing to see how the antagonist(s) are evolving while the protagonists are also evolving by becoming adults or adults with struggles becoming even stronger. What you'll get is a science-fiction, horror, drama, comedy, all mashed into one.

(spoiler-free sypnosis) During the late 70's, a young girl born into Big Pharma/Tech/Government blah blah is being studied for her strong telepathic abilites for reasons unknown and clashes with a group of misfit youths who have a bigger problem when one of them disappears out of thin air. That's it. That's all you need to know -- really.

It's a giant time period piece filled with nods to the movies and tv shows that made us love the simpler times. There are homages to the greats like Stephen King, Wes Craven, Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter. Some may say it's fan-service but the Duffer Brothers wanted to explicitly make an original story surrounded by what we loved about PG movies that clearly should have been PG-13 or R (Goonies/Poltergeist) among other things such as how adult-like children were and the rise of heavy metal and Dungeons and Dragons.

The film has no political commentary but will make fun of both sides in hints that it's all dumb. The actors look and convince that they were products of the time and is very convincing.

Each season is a presented as a sequel to a movie (as sequels were like the baby boomers of media in the 80s), and each one the antagonist grows stronger and every character has a unique utility to out-smart it. Both the adult and youth characters are likable even when they are being butt-heads -- they all grow.

Overall, must-watch entertainment especially during Halloween. It's a giant mix of horror and comedy and every scene has an easter egg to film/tv/bpoks during that era and even BEFORE. I'm not a fan of almost all media coming out today as it's heavily pandering to one-side of the aisle but this is heavily recommended. I didn't give it a 10/10 because it's Netflix and their policies are B. S."

"I just finished the last episode of season 4 and that was QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, I was shocked by how long the episode was but every second of it was entertaining. Season 3 was personally my favorite because I think that season had the most comedic scenes, and it just felt very vibrant in general. I LOVED HOPPER AND JOYCE and I'm so excited to see them in future seasons as well. So excited for season 5!!"
"Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.

It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix."
"I can't believe the first time I tried to watch the first episode of season 1 I didn't get into. What?!? I must have been having an off day.

I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1-3. The kids are just perfectly cast, and work so well together. The adult cast couldn't be better. I couldn't wait to see what happened after the end of sn 3 (unfortunately,,, lots happened in the world, and really slowed things down). Then finally,,,

Season 4 brought everything to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL!!! First,, every episode was either a mini movie, or a full blown movie (as far as the run time goes). From the opening of ep 1, everything is different from previous seasons bc our group has become scattered. Joyce, Will, Jonathan, and El are in California now, while everyone else is back in Hawkins. While Jonathan has adapted to life in Cali (he's become a bit of a stoner along with his buddy Argyle, who drives a van to deliver pizza from the SURF PIZZA ?? chain), and Joyce has found a thriving new job where she can work from home,, Eleven has had a more difficult time. While still reeling from losing her adoptive Dad, Hopper, along with losing her powers,, she has become the target of ridicule and bullying from a group of California kids at school. At her age, it's tough for any child to adapt to theirs surroundings,, but for El,, the deck is always stacked against her. Will is also having troubles, but for him it's more of the estrangement from everything he's known, along with the realization that he's probably never going to feel normal after what he's been through.

In Hawkins, Dustin, Lucas, and Mike have joined a D&D club called Hellfire, by their ""interesting"" leader Eddie Munson (the quintessential metal head of the 80s). However, Lucas has also joined the basketball team in an effort to gain popularity. Max, on the other hand is still reeling from the events that took place at the end of sn 3 (Billy's death, etc). She's even been visiting the school counselor, and although she'd broken up with Lucas at some point, he still tries to reach her to no avail.

Nancy is still chasing down stories as a budding journalist while Steve and Robin toil away at the video store (we saw them get hired at in the last ep, sn 3).

Overall, life seems to be going okay in Hawkins,, at least on the surface, that is. The upside down is still lurking just on the other side,, and a great evil is making itself known to the teenagers in Hawkins. Especially teens who've gone through certain trauma,,,

I don't want to say too much (cause I'll give too much away),, but this season should win all kinds of awards!!! I can only hope that the last season will be as good (don't know how they can top this).

So much happening in this season. I really can't emphasize this enough. Your emotions will be drained after watching, but in the best way possible.

The big bad guy's name is Vecna, and he is one of THE greatest villains I've ever seen!! So evil, so scary, just incredible.

I'm literally on pins and needles wanting to see season 5!! Of course,, we'll probably have to wait til 2024 before they get it on Netflix,,, ugh.

P. S. Really!! If you enjoyed sns 1-3,, this season blows them out of the water several times over!!"
"This series is set in '80s Hawkins, Indiana. As it opens twelve year old friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson and Lucas Sinclair are playing Dungeons and Dragons. Shortly afterwards Will vanishes; he has been taken to 'The Upside Down'; a dark parallel universe. Around the same time a mysterious girl, known as Eleven (shortened to El), turns up. It later becomes apparent that she has telekinetic powers and is being looked for by workers at a secretive facility. As the story progress's Will's friends befriend El and she helps them try to find him. His mother is convinced that he is trying to communicate with her.

I've only described the basic plot of season one; the second and third seasons follow on with new, but related stories with most of the same characters and some new ones.

I really enjoyed this series from the start of the first season to the end of the third. Perhaps it was because I was in my early teens in the early eighties I really enjoyed the nostalgia factor despite the fact that I was growing up in rural Oxfordshire not small town America... of course I was watching American films like ET and late '50s set 'Stand By Me'. The group of friends in this particularly reminded me of the boys in the latter of those films. The story provides some good scary moments and a great atmosphere with threats that are a combination of fantasy and sci-fi... creatures beautifully mirroring the Dungeon and Dragon monsters in the game the boys play. The characters are great; most obviously the boys, Eleven, Will's mother Joyce and Jim Hopper, the town's sheriff. The cast is really good; the youngsters are really great making their characters believable even during the most fantastical of scenes. Millie Bobby Brown particularly stands out as Eleven; a character that is both vulnerable and at times potentially dangerous. The adult cast is impressive too. The effects, an impressive mix of CGI and physical effects, impressively bring the more supernatural elements of the film to life. Overall I'd certainly recommend this series to fans of the genre... I can't wait for season four."
"Stranger Things was an amazing surprise upon watching it I had no idea what kind of adventure was ahead of me. The best way to put this show is a love letter to the '80s classics that captivated a generation. 'Stranger Things' is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.

I loved everything about this show, the cast were absolutely breathtaking, If I started to note on each one I liked we'd be here all day but some really did stand out to me like Joe Kreery as Steve Harrington, by far my favourite from start to nearly finish as we have one more round to go.

I highly recommend watching this, I absolutely loved it! Bring on season to 5!"
"Since its debut last year, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will's disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there's the contrast between Will's family and Mike's family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.

From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn't disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will's distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her ""cute"" roles, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.

And remember, the bad men are coming.

*I understand that the show's creators tracked down the makers of the era's board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries."
"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.

From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.

I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
"Dark, creepy, and wonderfully intriguing, this series set in the 1980s will remind you of many a sci-fi or horror movie from this era, in the nicest way you can imagine. There is little violence and gore, but the atmosphere is very tense and scary, and because there are relatable child and parent characters, the whole family will have someone to root for. Stranger Things is a bit spooky for younger kids, but tweens and teens will be interested in the mystery and finely drawn characters, and adults will be amused by the vintage clothing, technology, and prices, as well. The bravery of young heroes, who are always ready, willing and able to avert catastrophe when the adults in their lives fail."
"The monsters. The 80s nostalgia. The pacing. This show is so well done. It keeps a solid pace and it makes sure to keep everything correct to the time, even the food packages. Definitely recommend watching."
"I was not interested in seeing this but my daughter made me sit with her cos she wanted explanation about each n every thing associated with the 80s.

And to be honest, after completing the first 3 seasons, i can definitely vouch that fellas who were kids in the 80s will enjoy this.

Some amazing homages : Stand By Me, Firestarter, The Blob, Back To The Future, NeverEnding Story, The Thing, The Goonies, E. T., Ghostbusters, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Gremlins, IT, Risky Business, Star Wars Episode V, The Evil Dead, Day of the Dead, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Woody Woodpecker Show, Halloween 2, They Live (alleyway fight), Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Terminator, Scanners, Aliens, Karate Kid, Jaws, The Predator, Poltergeist, Indiana Jones, The Mist, Cujo, etc.

But the best homages were the arcade games n the vhs store."
"I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.

With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.

Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.

EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.

Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons."
"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET.

The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series.

The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10"
"Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it."
"The 8 episodes of the First season flew by unnoticed in the extraordinary film atmosphere. The creators managed to shoot a unique work, in which the motives of famous books and films of previous years are guessed. The sci-fi character sets the main tone for the entire tape, but high-quality directing does not give even a second to get bored. An exciting plot, a cool game of actors, diversity and retrospectives, coupled with fascinating music, immerse the viewer in a world that you do not want to part with. This is a film that is interesting to reflect on, discuss with friends and even draw parallels with your own realities. Each episode is a new batch of intrigues and impressions, secrets and solutions, almost always unpredictable. The ending of the first season leaves a lot of questions... To the delight of everyone who has managed to fall in love with Stranger Things, the release of season 4 is expected soon, which has been postponed many times due to the pandemic! In the meantime, there is time to reflect on what he saw, and maybe watch the series again in the company of interesting people. I think this film will also appeal to modern teenagers, for whom the entourage of the 80s with its games, customs and traditions will appear in a new light. Everyone in this film will be able to find a favorite hero, according to their ideals and preferences. In particular, I would like to note the highly professional game of Finn Wolfard, who played Michael. His character is an example of a kind, truly bright boy who knows the value of friendship. To be honest, throughout the season I often caught myself thinking an annoying thought - why wasn't I like this as a child? There was also a place for tears, which it was sometimes impossible to restrain (although I am not so sentimental). The film is really addictive, as if you are experiencing events, joy and pain together with the characters. A movie for a wide audience with meaning and a great plot!

And who has become your favorite hero for you? And if you haven't watched the first season yet, then don't hesitate and call your friends!"
"(Review updated after Season 4).

Hawkins, Indiana, 1983. A young boy, Will Byers, goes missing near a top secret government laboratory. On the same night, a strange young girl appears at a diner in the town. She has telekinetic powers and is on the run from the laboratory. The laboratory is researching supernatural phenomena and may have unwittingly unlocked a gateway to another dimension.

Superb series. I am generally not into science fiction, fantasy, supernatural or horror movies or TV series but this is different. Had me hooked from the start and never let go. Incredibly intriguing: the mystery surrounding Will, the girl's background and powers, how all these hang together and what forces are at work. Very well thought-out plot, superbly executed.

Very engaging too - many likeable characters, all given decent depth. The relationships between all the main characters and how these evolve make the series. If it wasn't for these it would be just another horror series.

Many of the concepts aren't overly new - I was reminded of The Cabin In The Woods, Stand By Me and Cloverfield - but the way everything is brought together is.

Good performances. David Harbour is excellent as Sherriff Hopper and the kids do incredibly well: good casting. Winona Ryder, the only big name in the cast (until Sean Astin and Paul Reiser appear in Season 2) is a bit irritating as Joyce Byers, though that might be the fault of her character (and thus the writers and directors). The hysteria is laid on a bit thick...

After an excellent Season 1, Seasons 2 and 3 are just as good. Season 4 feels a bit bloated though, with several sub-plots on the go at the same time, some of which are peripheral to the main plot. The movie-length episodes don't help either.

S4 comes together quite well in the end though and at least shows that the writers haven't run out of ideas (which is always a worry, that a show keeps going even though the originality has dried up). If anything they've got too many ideas and need to work on editing and condensing them.

Season ratings: S1-3 10/10, S4 8/10."
"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.

You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story.

I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing.

You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.

I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in."
"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones.

'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard.

Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious.

Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else.

Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic.

Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well.

Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers.

Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Awesome characters, great story, great balance between drama and action, love the humour in the series.... In my opinion it is a must watch."
Not only did Ryder play the perfect role for this series. The plot and sequences played to a awesome playback to Generation X. Plus the soundtrack is great.
"S1= secret agencies, mysterious experiments, physic powers,the dark subject matter of the abuse of these subjects to exploit such powers, and the thrilling escape from these nefarious machinations.

S2= we get to explore the other world, foreboding air of danger throughout, development and growth of the gang. Similar tone as the 1st season and closes it well.

S1+S2 fits and works together.

S3=budget feels halved, core group split up for nearly the whole season, big CGI monster that looks at home in Resident Evil 2 or The Evil Within 2 video game, contrived setups , poor consistency , cheap guard costumes and lazy jokes.

Even worse thing is that they somehow made the characters flat one-note archetypes, with romances shoehorned in. It's quite sad for what S3 has turned out to be.

Guess it could be summed up as if it was made cause fans wants a new season (naturally since S1 and S2 was good) , and the producers and creators decide to chase the money that comes with that. Rather then working at it until they have something interesting to show, they just went with a hackjob of various 80s cliches.

And of course in analyzing why the drop in quality is so dramatic, we also need need to look at the pressure the suits must be pressing on the showmakers. Imagine an even greater fall in Netflix stocks if S3 was not made in time ....."
"This show has pretty much everything one would want in a sci-fi show, it's not over-the-top, has VERY good characters, some of the best character design I've ever seen actually, and has some pretty freaky creatures. The soundtrack is also phenomenally made, as it captures the nostalgic-80's theme really well while still seeming modern. Needless to say, I find it very hard to find a SINGLE thing wrong with this show, it's easily one of if not my favorite show. This show manages to pull off the comedy-horror mixture in a way that I've never seen, I typically hate when those two are mixed but this show has the perfect balance of both.

The only thing I can poke at it for, is if you are one to not like following multiple storylines, than that might bring this show down a bit, however I don't see it as much of an issue as they actually do it quite well in a way that's not confusing like some shows with multiple storylines, good news is they lead in to each other as well most of the time, instead of being completely useless and just to use up screen time.

This show is definitely a must see."
"My Favorite TV series so far, this series it's so good I can't wait for the next season, season 4, I hope that eleven not lose her power. The CGI, cinematography I love it, this series is so recommend to watch with your friends, please I can't even describe it beacuse this series is too good. I really love they're chemistry.

Like every season they're giving us surprise with they new villain, story, and of course new characters. Duffer brothers was so genius how he can think like season 4 connect with every past in Season 1-3. Dustin and Steve always cary the show and they were so funny."
"This series is set in '80s Hawkins, Indiana. As it opens twelve year old friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson and Lucas Sinclair are playing Dungeons and Dragons.

Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied.

There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.

It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix. AI highly recommend watching this, I absolutely loved it! Bring on season to 5!"
"Love the characters and 80s nostalgia. Some great character development, especially with Steve.

Coherent world building, which for an original sci fi is super unusual and great overall plot(s).

Really loving this (fourth) season - show just keeps getting better and better."
"I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is."
"Just finished watching the volume 1 of season 4 of stranger things and I had a blast watching it. 2 times darker, scarier, bloodier than the previous 3 seasons

The production value this season went to another level. Each and every episode clocked more than an hour long (75 minutes on an average), but all of them were so gripping. The BGM was intense, and I became a fan of one song called ""Running up that hill"" by Kate Bush.

Episode 7 ( The Massacre at Hawkins Lab) and 4 (Dear Billy) are the longest but are the best of the lot. You'll be on the edge of your seat while watching these two episodes

Now, onto the storylines. Without a doubt, the Hawkins storyline was the darkest and scariest. The California storyline seemed forced at once but picked up steam from episode 3. Hopper's storyline had no connection with the main story but contained all the action part of part 1. Eleven's storyline became very interesting as many secrets from the past were revealed in her storyline

Like always, Millie Bobby brown is given the most screentime and she shines in the role yet again. Sadie sink too got to perform really well as she was also given more screentime as compared to the previous seasons she was in. Winona Ryder and David Harbour are completely sidelined, still they do their job in the limited screen time provided to them

It's a delight to watch the chemistry of Gaten Matarazzo and Joe Keery and they handled the comic part well as always. Caleb's character needed more meat and could be written more well this season. Matthew Modine is amazing. Natalia Dyer and Maya Hawke's chemistry works well. As for the new entrants this season, Jamie Campbell Bower just owns every scene he is in (I can't reveal his identity otherwise it will be a spoiler), Joseph Quinn registers an impact as Eddie Munson, leader of the hellfire club followed by Mason Dye as the devastated Jason Carver.

Final word- If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favour and watch it and get hyped for VOLUME 2 like the rest!!!"
"I'll leave my score at 8/10 in homage to seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 left me with very mixed emotions, most of them negative. I wont go into the issues as many others here have listed them well. For me, just as you saw a glimmer of hope that the storyline was emerging from the wreck, it crashed again with spurious awkward out of place dialogue, irritating characters and messages. Stereotypical bad guys and most of the questions raised left unanswered. By the end I just felt sad and annoyed."
"Talk about a return to form. After the disappointing season 3, my expectations for season 4 were quite low but I have to say this is the best after the first one. It surpasses season 3 in every possible way: better story, better acting, less dull moments, and the revelation in episode 7 (which I won't give away) is excellent. I can't wait to watch the rest."
"Season 1

This series sets environment right from the start of its first episode. The plot of the series is very interesting. Storyline keeps you engaged. The Duffer Brothers has directed the series so well. Each and every scene looks completely new. As the series progresses the environment becomes so tense and scary. It keeps you at the edge of your seat.

The acting is outstanding from the entire cast. Each character has portrayed its role with absolute perfection.

The background music is excellent. Visual effects are also good. In the tense and scary scenes background score makes your spine chill.

Overall, ""Stranger Things"" is a must watch series!

Season 2

Second season is a good continuation of the first season. Storyline is good this time also. In second season bond between characters is shown beautifully. There's much time given for character development so we feel more connected to the characters this season. Last few episodes are very tense and you will be thrilled by the climax.

Season 3

Despite being Netflix's most streamed series (65M+ views for the third season), I wonder why people criticise this third season. Strange things get on a bigger level in the third season. Problem is now bigger to face. This season is very interesting to watch. Waiting for the fourth season..."
This show continues to deliver. Stays true to the 80s and the music choices are amazing! The relationship between characters are very authentic. I can watch several times and not get bored.
"All seasons are enjoyable and interesting. Season 4 finale was different and unexpected, & I think thats a credit to the shows smart writers. All the best shows should make it unpredictable at times- then it helps to keep the story fresh and the momentum alive- if its the same plot every season then its never going to get any better. Im looking forward to whats instore next season."
"The series was Epic in the first season, there is a start to its level, I am afraid of the fourth season"
"In my opinion Stranger Things gets better as it goes on! Lots of homages, amazing story, cinematography, thought provoking, and fun to watch. Not everyone loves as much as me which is unfortunate and ok too. I think it's really unfortunate that Stranger Things hasn't really Emmys or golden globes I think it highly deserves them. I'm a bit late to seeing season 3 but damn it's spectacular even if I'm the only one and the HDR quality for my 4K TV is vibrant awesomeness with nice colors."
"That tv show have a very good 80's vibes, some relationship that can get us entertained because some of them are funny and some mysteries all along the seasons. Love the change each season. Very well made monsters. Dont know what to say else. Its worth w tching for sure."
"I am finishing up first part of Season 4 right now, I am on rye edge of my seat. Consistently use nostalgia, interesting characters, & supernatural stories, & 80's issues to build an amazing story with a great ensemble cast (most started as pre-teens). The Duffers deserve so much credit, through 80's pop culture nostalgia, they have built the biggest pop culture show that hasn't let us down yet...unlike other massive shows (Sopranos & Game of Thrones."
"I just love this and I really like season 4 this year I thought that vecna was great what he was supposed to which was be scary, and I really did also like more talk about eleven past which I thought was great and I wish season five came earlier but it is what it is but I also realized that the duffer brothers were not that happy about the actors growing up in the show but I am still happy with their acting and I think that they are all talented in their own way but I was not really all impressed with will this season but the other seasons he was great! And for everybody reading this in the comments rate Dustin out of ten because he's my favorite."
I have been impressed with Netflix original tv series and been binge watching all the episodes and seasons and I have to say this is very well written series if you need something to watch I recommend stranger things you won't be disappointed because the twists and plots get interesting and the characters are great
"_On season 1: A cult series that will show the path for many generation to come

Some series are meant to last and Stranger Things is one of them.

The mixture of awesome script, directing and acting by the whole ensemble bring to life a world of friendship and loyalty which will stand the test of time. Most sincere congratulations to the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy for this amazing journey. Please keep up the good work for as many seasons you deem fit. My awe for the whole cast for their superb, awards-winning and believable play. The chemistry between the young actors is just unbelievable.

And lastly, my true, emotional and special congratulation to Millie Bobby Brown, without whom the series just would not work.

She is the soul of the series.

Millie, you just shine.

On season 3: What can I say. We waited 21 months for this season. We as the fans, hoped for a wonderful season full of mystery and stranger things, but we were let down.

In some aspects this season is enhanced. We have more special effects and more work on the monster business and devilish plans. But!, That was not what made stranger things great in the first place. What made it great was the underneath mystery, the thrill and most of all the awesome chemistry between the characters.

Season 3 lost almost all that, the interaction are shallow, more cheesiness than I could count, an unbelievable storyline, many fill-up scenes and some musical stuff in an ultra important moment, seriously?!

Our characters are not the characters that we love and feel pride about their strengths, powers and weaknesses anymore. Adding characters without enough depth, background and creating unbelievable and weak story lines almost always lead to catastrophe.

The directors and producers seem to have been voodooed to provide us fans with this season 3 after season 1 (the strongest) and the acceptably good season 2.

It is as if their work and ideas have been hindered and meddled with leading to a let-down season. They need to accept their mistakes, they know better what they are, work hard on them and deliver us with a better, shinier and more powerful season 4 in another 1-1.5 year.

Dear directors and producers, a humble suggestion to you, never weaken the soul of the series, Eleven.

Never take her diamond spark away. You know what I mean. Everybody to work please for an awesome and stronger than ever season 4.

Netflix, you too, you have your share of contribution.

On season 4 (preliminary): As most may know now, Netflix has decided to deliver season 4 as a two-part season on May 27 and July 1, 2022. I'm unhappy about it as I was with La Casa de Papel final season schedule. It is my opinion that that's a (big) mistake and will only serve to ruin the flow of season 4 after waiting for it for nearly 3 years.

I know that the network executives won't change their minds, but nevertheless hope so, in order to be delivered in one shiny pack on the 27 of May."
"Can't believe I never reviewed this yet, I was convinced I had. The premiere in 2016 hooked me and never let me go. The show that arguably launched streaming into the mainstream.

Stranger Things is pure nostalgia magic. But saying it just does undersells pretty much every other aspect of the show. Exceptionally solid actors and characters, excellent writing, incredible score, the list goes on.

As far as seasons go, season one is essentially perfect, enough mystery to want more but simple enough to be loved and enjoyed. Captured the magic of the 80s, even if you haven't lived those years. The childlike fun, it takes you right back. Season 2 and 3 try to repeat this but mostly miss out on some of the elements that made season 1, and now season 4 as well.. Horror. They both contain much more mystery and horror and that is one of the big pulls imo of this show, get you on your toes once in a while. S2-3 where focused more on fun, and went a bit too far with the whole Russian mall plot in S3.

I can't overstate how good Season 4 is and feels like a comeback, back to form and for that I cannot wait to see the next season. Stranger Things has a unique hold on 80s nostalgia, a combination of fun and horror. Season 4 manages to really expand on Eleven's story and gives a ton of meaningful depth on her character. We got lot's of time with Papa and everything surrounding it. The villain was good, though his form/the way he took shape didn't impress me as much, I wished it to be more disturbing/scary looking. But it's backstory is what gives the villain strength here. Also the underlying themes of mental health are well executed and never blatantly explained or anything, maybe I'm even reading into it too much but it's definitely the vibe I got. In general season 4 showcases a more diverse set of struggles which some characters have to deal with, sexuality, communication, rejection. Just a very diverse selection with a pretty big cast by now.

Eddie Munson was a fantastic addition to season 4, he grew to be one of the most likable characters in a very short while even whilst they put us on the wrong foot. The stoner friend was alright but never a comedic relief I cared too much about.

Directing has been rock solid the whole series so far, every shot looks beautiful and it just hooks you in. Just fantastic and never slacks. Set design as well, it so much 80s, it's perfectly done.

Combined with the directing and editing the Music is just the finishing touch to making a perfect series like this. The songs are expertly chosen and this show does not shy away from using music as much as they can. Honestly, if they'd use less the show would feel completely different. But that synth is everywhere and you will always know you are watching something in 80s. This could also get old, but hasn't for me as of yet. Music plays a huge part in this show and it just elevates so many scenes, expertly chosen.

Characters, what can I say, wat is there not to like? The writing is just so good for most of them, though sometimes it leans a bit too hard into comedy/cheese but it's alright. They toned it down a lot in S4, S3 being the worst offender of poor(er) writing.

S4 story wise was some of the best, the three different storylines blending into one towards the end. But also the diversity of those storylines was what kept it all so interesting and great to watch. In particular here, even though it was the worst story in S3, the Soviet storyline in S4 was my favorite of the bunch. Harbour gives another excellent performance but Gellman and Ryder also give their best. Djuricko (Yuri) and Wlaschiha (Dimitri) also very great, well written and very enjoyable.

The finale of S4 was great, did it need to be a single episode with a length of two and half hours? Not really, it could've been split up in my opinion. But still it was great, though the stakes were lower in the end than I had hoped (even though that would've hurt). Though whereas other seasons didn't end on as heavy of a cliffhanger, this one did. And we know exactly what were are in for with Season 5. The final season. Regarding music, notably they used the ''When It's Cold I Like to Die.'' and my god, that's one heavy song that slapped me in the face, I've heard it before so I knew what was coming after those first few piano notes. Great choice but a gut puncher.

I would have a lot more to say if I edited this review season by season but I never did until now, too late. I'm sure this series will go down as one of the big ones. Maybe it already is but it still needs to stick the landing. And I can't wait for that. But I will be sad that a show like this will be hard to replicate again. You really do get jealous of people who lived the 80s, though of course, it's romanticized here by a lot."
"I didn't have much interest when it first came out. I took me until the release and ads of Season 4 that sparked my interest.

Here we have a near perfect show, one that surprised me with a shockingly connecting every season turned out to be.

The characters are hard not to love, the nods to nostalgia, I didn't expect the 80's to be a backdrop I was going to love for this show.

The stand out characters for me are definitely Nancy, Steve, Robin, Lucas, Max, & most importantly Eleven. The rest have their moments but these were my top. I would say the weakest & most annoying character is Will.

Each seasons major monster were greatly imaginative I felt like this show gave me an 80's X-Files, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Goonies all wrapped into one. I cannot recommend this show enough.

Looking forward to season 5."
"REVIEW - STRANGER THINGS

Originally I didn't watch the first season as it was marketed as a kids program but I'm sitting here now binge watching the first season and this children's TV program literally outshines all others.

A true masterpiece of story telling and the acting is the best I have ever seen.

Amazingly gripping on all fronts.

If there is one thing you do this Halloween then you must watch Stranger Things

Rating 10 out of 10"
"Good Series. Everybody acted very well in the movie. The series was so interesting and thrilling from the beginning. The series bored and lagged at the middle of the series. After some episodes, the series was so interesting and thrilling. Good Series."
"Not since the early 2000's, has there been such an eagerly awaited genre TV series finale.

And my word. Does this deliver edge of the seat drama? Yes, it does.

After four seasons, loyal viewers are now fully invested in these characters; involved in their fights, and intrigued by their outcome. You care for the plight of all involved, as you watch chess pieces across a decimated board fall into place, for epic battles. Who will survive? Who will fall? Watch to find out! It's intricate, its horrific, it's fascinating; it's ultimately human!

The pacing, soundtrack, cinematography and direction of this show, are second only to plot and character. As it should be.

Is it derivative? YES!! But with enough originality that it remains singular.

Creativity lives!! Thank the gods!!!"
"Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!"
"Stranger Things is filled with suspense, chuckles, tears, excitement, thrills, surprises, and even sometimes non-cheesy romances (don't get Nancy involved).

Season One: Everybody likes season one. Its the season that started the whole show and is filled with suspenseful twist and turns. I love the style of everything adding up in the end. The only negative is Nancy's romance.

Season Two: This season is pretty much a copy of the first season. Although I would consider it narrowly below season one's level of amazingness.

Season Three: This season is very controversial for many Stranger Things fans. I don't understand what makes this season so bad for some people. For me, having a little bit of chessyness in order to have comedy and a very emotional last episode is a decent trade. This season is the tinniest step down from the last seasons, not a massive step like some people think.

Season Four: This new season is much different than the other seasons. This season takes a more horror route than Stranger Things did before, and has a few episodes that stand out as truly amazing (episode 4, 7, and 9). The only downside is the length of the episodes. I feel like Netflix caused this, but it still doesn't make a huge impact to the season overall. Thinking about it I truly think this is my favorite season.

If you've read through this whole review congratulations, I would've skipped it because it was to long. Now, stop reading this review and go watch Stranger Things!"
"Can't understand the following that this has. This show has not got an original idea in it's head. It's like watching The Force Awakens 3 times in a row! The set up of character and story is exactly the same with every season, with annoying characters and stupid sub-plots thrown in for good measure.

Season 1 IS NOT brilliant television which some people will tell you it is. This is not The Wire or The Sopranos. This show isn't in the same Galaxy as those classic TV Shows.

The first season copies everything from The X-Files to Stephen King to nostalgia Spielberg films from the 80's. It also plays on the 'there's a government conspiracy cover up'. Because we haven't seen that before have we.

Season 2 has the same set up about a place called the upside down where a monster comes from so the kids get together (like they did in S1) They have to fight a monster (like they did in S1) Eleven has to defeat the monster (like she did in S1) Season 2 is actually worse because this has a 7th episode that has absolutely nothing to do with the episode prior or after it and can be ignorned completely. They only put this in because Milly Bobbie Brown wasn't getting enought screen time and clearly her agent was upset about this!! If you have seen any of her press conferences with her co-stars she clearly has to be the centre of attention and everything has to be about her!!

Season 3 starts with yet another monster coming over from another dimension and yep you guessed it the gang get back together and Eleven saves the day yet again. At no point during this overlong and tired series do you fell that any of these kids are going to be in danger. Season 3 is by far the worse however as they fell the need to force left wing politics into it's storytelling just like the trash Disney films are doing. There is also a ridiculous subplot between Winona Ryder and David Harbour that fells that is should be in another show. It's just them arguing that fells like an episode out of Eastenders.

Non of these characters have progressed over three seasons. Eleven is as powerful in Season 3 as she was in Season 1. The character arcs are terrible that have no development. They are there to serve a creature feature. The effects are ok but you've seen all this before. The kids are average but nothing special even though they are clearly written as The Goonies.

Season 4 threatens to do the exact same predictable and boring set up with no emotional pay-off. At this stage I am completely uninvested in any of these characters because S4 will follow the same predicable and safe formula.

Hugely overrated!!"
"I don't know what happened but this is a different show, it's almost a comedy now. Everything about it feels off, the pacing, the directing, the dialogue and writing, even the characters are almost caricatured versions of themselves. Only fitting that My Bologna by Weird Al played in the second episode.

First two seasons were great, S3 is a parody of those two."
"This is one of the most magical things I have ever had the fortune of viewing. I won't go into details about the narrative, which is build on classic sci-fi and horror concepts and it works. But what really makes this show excel is the little things. The casting is amazing - every single character, regardless of how small the part is, feels like a complete character, and the main cast delivers some powerful stuff all throughout the series. The production is spot on in it's portrayal of a small town in the 80's, and I have to assume that it is in part based on the creators own experiences and childhood, because everything feels real.

The only thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was the incompetence of the government entities. I know and understand that this is a popular portrayal of the government in these types of stories and especially in the US is this a common sentiment. But it simply didn't seem believable that they would make some of the choices they did. Doesn't take a genius to see that they are doing a crummy job. But this is all in all a negligible detail, as it keeps the story moving."
"The sloppy writing, directing and acting are over the top in this season. All of the actors have become self-conscious of themselves and too fond of themselves. The writing is just childish. This should have been a season of come backs and excitement, but it is not. Someone, please tell your make up people that women in dire, life-threatening situations don't show up in full make up and lipstick. Please tell the special effects people that blood doesn't turn orange as it dries. The whole season is more of a comic book for teenagers than entertaining for adults. If that is the production goal, they have succeeded. I am not going to watch in the future should they continue the series."
"This is a series that grips you from the start. Lots of action, Monsters, sexual innuendo and plot. Highly recommend this series on Netflix.

Great cast and 3 wonderful seasons."
"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.

Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.

Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again."
"I honestly found the trailer worrying a few months from release, and sadly I was right. Season 1 and 2 are brilliant. I love this show. Season 3 unfortunately drop the ball astronomically. I found most of it predictable, cringeworthy, boring, unreal Russians being the ridiculous bad guys from like a cartoon sitcom. 80% of the dialog is pointless filler, there is no progression from season 2. We learn nothing new about the Upside down world, about Eleven.

Over all it doesn't capture the essence of the original Season 1 and 2. Hugh Disappointment."
"Seasons 1& 2 were great. But Season 3 is overkill. Why is it necessary to flog something to death? This a common problem with so many series - basically success creates greed, and the need for recognition knows no bounds. Season 3, episodes 1 & 2 are ridiculous, a complete waste of time. Things pick up a bit in episode 3 but by episode 8 is so predictable as to become boring. Should have quit at the end of Season 2."
"I mean, no serious plot holes, and some solid acting on behalf of most of the cast, , but nothing stellar, either. A pretty solid, average score of 5.

Surprisingly, I find Ryder's acting to be the most irritating out of anyone's in the cast. She strikes me as shrill, with very little nuance. I think the series would be much better without her."
"Season 1: Flawless Season 2: Entertaining but cheap Season 3: A joke

I don't want to give anything away, but if you are interested in watching this show, just watch the first season only and pretend if the following seasons never happend.

As usual, the writers are lead by the success of the first season. After that it's a mixture of stolen ideas from various iconic movies. Or in other words: nothing new.

Why not just stop after one successful season? This is exactly the reason why I hardly ever try to start watching a serie, and also why I've never finished one. Just write a story, with a beginning and an end which is already set. Don't be lead by the success and push it to the point where people are no longer stunned by the concept. Keep your old chlichés."
"I didn't think Stranger Things could get any better, but it did. Season 1, more nostalgic, with a variety of classic 80s film nods and alternative music, followed by the development of the characters and the depth of the story reaches its peak in season 3. But season 4... just wow. Literally one of the best things I've EVER seen, each episode almost like it's own movie, all staying true to its 80s roots, and the simple and yet great narrative of good vs evil.

I'm an 80s child, the era that this is set in my was 10yrs old, and all that romance, coolness, neon, eclectic, vibrant decade is pulled through this show, probably the greatest TV series of all time."
"Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 regular OK. But they ruined everything on 3rd season turning it into a childish sunday afternoon movie, full of cliches, sketchy BD-like villans and failed attempts to make comedy wich ended up destroying all the great misterious atmosphere of the 1st season. It's a shame."
"After the first two top-quality seasons, Season 3 is very disappointing, full of rehashed material and almost a parody of itself. Most episodes are full of padding, with characters waffling endlessly about irrelevant things, and side-stories sprouting all over the place. It has a few funny moments, notably when two teenage characters get stoned on truth serum in the penultimate episode. Otherwise this show could only appeal to bored pre-pubescents who want to know how to kiss or talk to the opposite sex.

The most annoying thing about season 3 is that the main adult characters keep puffing on cigarettes in so many scenes, in some shameless promotion of tobacco. Other totally obvious product placements include the clearly inserted advertisements for Burger King and Coca-Cola. Let's hope Season 4 gets back on track, because this season's effort is a FAIL."
"Just loved the darker way this series goes with the kids getting older every season. For me this was the best season we got the answers about the gates to the other dimension. I love the story and how the 3 different story arcs goes together. Let's hope it gets even darker in the next season! If there was something to complain about then it was about splitting the season to part 1 and 2.

I read reviews in here that the actors were bad? I think it's amazing what they made with the cast they have. The acting is first class and you can't find another series with teens that delivers at this level! If you don't like it then you're probably to young or not a fan of horror series."
"This show is great and i recommend it to everyone because it has very good storytelling, very good plot and very awesome and likable characters.

I personally liked every season 1-4, and i am ready to watch season 5.

And as i wrote, this show has very good characters that are very likable and you actually care about them.

And it captures the feel of the 80's very good, and the music is very good too, even the kid actors in the earliest seasons were really good and they had really good acting skills.

The effects in this movie are excellent even the fricking cgi looks realistic.

And this show has also really great monsters.

So my final thought's are that i recommend this to everyone Who likes 80's movies 10/10."
First two seasons were great and then with 3 season they ruined everything.
"Losing its Spielberg meets King tone, Stranger Things' 80s seem more a collection of movie references than a milieu; however, the show is now structured less like a movie than episodes waiting for a cliffhanger. The evil Russians don't even feel like throwback villains since they've pretty much returned as a standard Hollywood trope, but where they're shoved in requires almost as much suspension of disbelief as the upside-down. Forcing us to believe two impossible things is maybe a bit much. The season's okay, some of the chemistry is still there, but it's running low on whatever the magic ingredient was."
"I just started watching season 1 and I heard it's the best one. I hung in there till about half-way, just cause the series had such high ratings, but somewhere around the 5th episode I couldn't take it anymore.

Of course I kind of want to know what happened to Will Byers, but the search for the missing kid is filled with lame, half-a** teenage drama between characters like Nancy, Steve and Jonathan who I'm not even half interested in. This is all to lead us away from the fact that the plot is completely empty and it seems as though they filmed the series without any plan whatsoever.

Unfortunately the lame conversations between hollow characters that lack personality are worsened even further by the terrible acting of almost all the actors involved, with the exception perhaps of two of the kids.

The character of Eleven is a true killer, in the worst way possible, especially because, even though she seems to speak English very well, she doesn't really speak and just keeps a blank stare on her face the entire time.

So if you'd like to watch about 7 hours of endless good-for-nothing screaming and drama, this series is for you!"
"Why not focus on making a good series that concludes on a high and leaves the viewer wanting more instead of dragging it on until every last dollar can be squeezed out while the viewers gradually leave in boredom and disgust?

Season 1 was brilliant. 9/10. Season 2 was watchable. 6/10. Season 3 was as engaging as watching a dead horse being flogged. I watched it hoping it would come to life, but it never did. 3/10.

Not only that, but there were some truly cringeworthy moments the Dusty and Suzie duet being right there at the top. If they'd panned a shot to the Mindflayer we would've probably seen it cringeing as well.

Needless to say I won't be watching Season 4."
"I'm the one who tries my best to pay attention to details, but I think Stranger Things is an amazing show, I've rewatched it multiple times! Even my kids love it. In Season 1, Episode 1, though, there is a dog located throughout the episode until near halfway, then Joyce takes the dog inside and that's the last we see of it. What happened to the dog? Other then that, and a few other details, I think this show is absolutely amazing! The camera stunts are spot on, the acting, the costumes, the music choice, just awesome! I'm so exited for Season 5, I can't wait to see what The Duffer Brothers have for us next!"
"Freddy Kruger is in Stranger Things!!! Season 4 has a real Nightmare on Elm Street vibe and sure enough... there he is, Freddy Kruger! Love it, love it, love it. Excellent series and masterful job on Season 4."
"I am very slow to hop on the Stranger Things train but I'm so glad I finally did!! I was born in 1981 and this is my show!! Seasons 1 & 2 were phenomenal!! I felt for Joyce as a mother and was on the edge of my seat. Hopper is one of the best characters I've seen in a long time. Steve...Steve is just the best!!! The four friends couldn't have been a better group of 80s kids. Their characters were such a perfect combination. Seasons 1 & 2 had great character development and the storyline was so intriguing. Season 3 lost some of the originality and I didn't love it. Season 4 was so much better and brought back what was missing in season 3. I'm sad there will only be one more season! This is such a unique, nostalgic and awesome show!"
"The first season was fantastic! The second season was a copy/paste without the magic. Unfortunately, the third season was just an empty mess. A complete waste of time."
"I don't know what to say but i have to force myself to watch this for the love of the first 2 season and my love for it. It turned into a damn comedy and sarcasm. Too much dialogue not enough mystery or suspense. It's like one of them ""They're back, welcome your favorite characters!! Aren't they cool!!!! Give them a round of applause!!!""

Closer to Back to the Future than Stranger Things Season 1-2.

Sigh.

DAMN

I promoted the hell out of this to people that haven't watch the serious. This one is an embarrassment. Not sure what to tell them after watching this."
"I loved the first season.

The second season really showed how you can seriously build character development and a good storyline.

Season 3 was a bit slow but gathered momentum and the lad couple of episodes were absolutely gripping.

Season 4 really made me realize that the writing for this show is deep and utilizing a pure 80s soundtrack to another level.

The episode dear Billy hit home so much around escaping your own demons and depression. I must have watched it over a dozen times.

The show is more than about some kid with special gifts, it's really about pure friendship and it really hits home.

Stranger things is the best show for so many reasons and you'll find a meaning that hits home for you.

It's cheesy but this show maybe helping people in ways that is unknown to many and stranger things can happen."
"Really really good.

I just hope that Netflix dont milk this series for too much more and ruin it.

One more series and its complete. Leave it there and it will be a classic."
"Instead of reviewing the basically perfect S01 and great S02, I will only comment on S03 in this review. The Duffer Brothers obviously ran out of ideas to borrow from Spielberg, and now they copy Cameron and other 80s action directors-auteurs, with mixed to terrible results. ST still looks amazing: style, color, SFX & VFX, sound and editing are as good as they've ever been, but the writing has been turned into lazy copy/paste, with a million bad puns and exaggerated character traits as well as fan service and 80s Easter egg hunt.

Almost every character in the series is now a caricature of their former self. Everything has been dialed up to 11 and that's not a good thing, because not every aspect of Season 3 needs to be aggressively inflated for it to make sense and be entertaining. Sometimes less is more. Oh, and yes, the evil guys are now Russians, whom are Scooby Doo villains.

The kids have turned into Ethan Hunt-type secret agents, all adults are morons, and there's an annoying emphasis on female empowerment and lack of privacy. I expect S04 to turn into an 8-episode telenovella with a few scares and thousands of 80s Easter eggs and references, instead of a well-wriiten, compelling storyline. It was great while it lasted. Goodbyen Stranger Things, hello El & Max, the most annoying female character after Janice from 'Friends'."
"This show has been amazing since the first season.

I remember when the show first came out. It was scary, eerie and had that unique 80s feeling to it.

The story of this show is unique, and the concept of the upside down is just fascinating...and scary.

I have just watched season 4 and it was nothing short of amazing. The way the characters have grown throughout the show, and the way all the seasons tie in with eachother is truly awesome.

I cannot wait for the final season to come out, and I'm sad that an amazing show like this is coming to an end. Hopefully, there will be opportunities for maybe a mini spin off series or something related to the stranger things universe in the future...but that's just wishful thinking.

If you haven't watched this show, I highly recommend you do."
I recommend it to anyone looking for a series if you have nothing to watch. You will be very hooked this series is a must-watch. I am just stunned by the fantastic acting of the actors.
"Season 1 was great, the setting , the themes, it all worked very well. Season 2 was on a repeat of season 1 and already left a bit of a sour taste Season 3 starts off quit well but turns into a mess, no interesting dialogue, the plot is lackluster, comedy and romance that detracts. If the trend continues season 4 will be a massive disappointment in the making.

Here's hoping they can turn it around!"
"This is a series that continues to go strength to strength. Truly expecting season four to be a little bit of a let down! I mean how can you continue to make tv of this calibre.

But the Duffer Brothers have produced an absolute gem. Full of nostalgia, a story line that continues to deliver and characters that are truly lovable.

If you haven't seen it; watch it.

Can't wait for season 4 part 2!"
My thoughts on Stranger Things have become more mixed over the years. I think season 1 is incredible. It offers some a great cinematic lens while giving compelling characters. Season 2 is really good but lacks the charm of the previous season. Season 3 is pretty mediocre imo. Feels like a parody of 80's nostalgia.
"We loved season one, season two seemed like a rehash, season three was funnier but so PC that we lost the characters that roped us in at the beginning. First, why would Russian spies in the middle of America at a mall wear uniforms? Second, how did they build a 50 story hideout under the mall without anyone noticing? Third, why are half the kids on the show coming out of the closet this season? Something in the PC Hollywood water? Fourth, how much did Coke pay for product placement? It was ridiculous. I liked the 80s references and wanna go buy an old Camaro now because they are still cool in 2019! The soundtrack was BANGING! Do the writers realize that each time L used her powers and her nose bled, that was a ""brain bleed?"" She has no more blood to bleed! They need to let the series go now -- it was a good ride but we have reached the end. Oh, almost forgot about the little Michelle O, a 12 year old scientist with a sailor's mouth and sense of entitlement -- not subtle. Men dumb, need women to save them, over and over and over. Overall, season three, enjoyed the jokes and music but hated the PC. Great show overall"
"Season 1 and 2 are magical. I binged them in a few days. I rarely get sucked into a show like this, but this was great. It had something for the kid in me, it had action, it had humor, the characters were likable, it felt like it had everything. It put you in the 80's and felt a little like Freaks and Geeks to me with a sci-fi twist to it which was fairly creepy and well made. The interactions between the characters were great and the chemistry was there, so thumbs up for Season 1 and 2.

That being said, I would stop watching at the end of season 2. Season 3 is a total piece of garbage. I am struggling to watch it, I'm at episode 5 now and it's not getting better. None of the characters feel like themselves. They are parodies at best of the characters they were in the first two seasons. But for the most part they feel like totally different characters, like I'm watching a different show. Everyone is angry and shouting, the plot makes almost 0 sense, the product placement is annoying to say the least... It's just sad, I feel betrayed almost. I initially thought they changed writers and directors because it felt so different...

So watch season 1 and 2 and leave season 3 alone... I watch it on my ipad while doing other things just because I feel I need to finish watching it now like a chore... but oh my God... season 3 is horrible..."
"Stranger Things is written & directed by The Duffer Brothers and stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Noah Schnapp and Cara Buono.

When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back.

Where to begin? Stranger Things is one of the most enjoyable pieces of television that I've experienced in years. With a satisfying eight episodes in its first season, The Duffer Brothers have delivered a multi- genre masterpiece that has taken the world by storm.

The writing throughout is smart and compelling, lending every actor/actress a real chance to delve into their respective characters and they all do so with impeccable skill. It's extremely difficult to pick out the highlighting performances when every single one of them were outstanding. But, I must mention the following names in appreciation of their talent. Millie Bobby Brown is seriously convincing in her portrayal of the mysterious Eleven (or 'Elle'), and although only twelve years old, she gives one of the most incredibly diverse and grown-up performances I've ever seen. Winona Ryder plays a distraught Joyce, mother of Will, who goes through many stages of emotional despair, breaking down and falling apart as she searches for her son, in an impressive and relatable act. Charlie Heaton follows Ryder in this path but takes a slightly different direction as he becomes one of the many powerful leads in the series, within a couple episodes. Heaton has undeniable chemistry with co-star Natalia Dyer (playing Nancy) and they both share some interesting moments together, most notably, in the final three episodes. David Harbour plays police chief, Jim Hopper, and progressively propels into his character as he digs deeper into the strange 'missing boy' case. Last but certainly not least, the Kids (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo & Caleb McLaughlin) are enthralling, fascinating and hugely entertaining as they search for their friend, Will (Noah Schnapp), and ultimately take the screen with surprisingly genuine, adult performances. Highlighting Matarazzo (Dustin) and Wolfhard (Mike) as my consistent favourites during my experience with the show.

Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein are in control of the score, taking huge inspiration from the 1980s, using synthesisers to construct an incredible ensemble soundtrack that in some way feels like its own character. Along with the show taking critical acclaim, the soundtrack manages to find an audience, be it fans of the show, composers, directors, producers, it seems everyone wants this sound in their work. Dixon & Stein have crafted and presented a stunning score, from the opening theme to the closing credits.

Something the show creators, set decorators, designers and costume departments have worked hard on is featuring many references paying homage to classic 70s/80s movies, and while it's packed with them, the writers strive in staying original in the storytelling. The plot is seemingly simple, yet once you begin watching you notice how complex it really is. Every episode is filled with mystery and tension. Even when you think the story is heading somewhere predictable, it alters drastically and heads off in another direction. I strongly believe that this is greatly due to its short run of eight episodes. There's no 'filler' episode in this show. It's an entirely fast-paced, energetic and powerful running length which will have you binge watching until you've seen it all. Lucky for us, a second season has been confirmed by Netflix, with a further nine episodes coming in 2017.

Verdict; There's simply nothing quite like Stranger Things. It's enthralling, engaging, emotional, heartfelt, funny, smart, complex and certainly entertains the viewer. Did I mention it also has a killer soundtrack? You're right, I did. - Stranger Things is now streaming on Netflix.

Stranger Things: Season One, 10/10."
"I don't know happened here but holy crp they messed this up on the writing and plot side. The actors perfomances are still very good (the new character is too) but the 'evil Russian' trope is ludicrous , the plot development makes no sense, the music and sound design is sub par."
This is up there for one of my favorite shows i have ever watched. The characters in this show might be my favorite group of characters in a show ever. The cinematography is second to none. The acting is mostly amazing. Every season is good. The creators of this show haven't missed. S4 was the best.
"There were countless moments when they could have acted much quicker e.g. escape, attack, run away, hide, etc. I mean the last episode - Jim Hopper said count to three with the keys? Seriously? You could have done it already. All they did was stood there and watched and looked panicked e.g. Nancy and Jonathan in the hospital; the kids not running away after Billy broke the sauna room glass window; Nancy in front of the car when Billy tried to crash them outside Starcourt in the last episode, etc. Max's character made her look silly and valueless. The continuous arguments between Jim and Joyce were unhelpful. I used to look up to Jim but he was off putting in this season - hot tempered, impatient and always yelling. Please don't ruin a good tv series like this."
"The first season is intelligent, smart and original. The second one has less ideas and the screenplay is so so but overall can be ok. The third season is terrible: the screenplay is at the level of a B or C movie. Some scenes are terrible longs and especially the last three episodes are really terrible."
"The first season was 10/10. I can't quite articulate what's been lost in seasons 2 and 3. The mystery I think? Part of the horror was watching people struggle against an unknown enemy - a single unknown enemy, another of season 2's downfalls. Also the fact that the children, teens, and adults were initially separate, fighting the same problem but with slightly different stakes and information, was really fun to watch in the first season. None of this is to say later seasons were bad (though 3 was better than 2), but they don't live up to the brilliance of the first season"
"I liked season 1 and maybe season 2 However season 3 was bad 1. All the ""suspense"" scenes were meaningless to me as you know that nothing will happen to any of the main characters. No matter the odds or how strong the opponent is you know that a fat police officer is able to obliterate an army of highly trained soldiers 2. The red scare in 2019 is unbelievable. ""The Russians are coming"". The ruskies built a whole military base in the middle of America! Is that believable! 3. Too much product placement ""cocacola"" in almost every scene possible really sucks

I was apathetic while watching the whole season"
"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things.

Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered.

The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable.

Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion.

Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10."
"If you want horror, humour, heart breaking, heroes & heroines, happening edge of your seat action, hope & hysteria. This is the show for you. This is not my generation show & I don't know why Netflix keep putting Shows like Ozark for Grammy awards. We have to move on. The kids are smart & hilarious."
"Season 1 was just awesome, season 2 was nice, too, but season 3?! Extreme lack of logic, kids infiltrating super secret military bases of the Russians (who are now suddenly the evil dudes?), too many unnecessary jokes, songs nobody wanted and overall too much of everything. Overall score: season 1 = 10/10, season 2 = 9/10, season 3 = 6/10 so a 7/10"
"S01 ok. S02 not good. S03 worst ever.

All male characters are clumsy fan idiots or evil enemy monsters.

All female characters are smart know-it-all geniuses or have superpowers or superinsticts.

I'm not against the hole Russia-America Cold War theme, after all it was an important matter those days but would have preferred less of that an more of the monsters.

Dialogs are so childish and predictable they endup boring. If it's a kids show then why the gunpoint killing? Why the adultery suggestion?

If you need to add a character and want it to be gay why link her to one of the main characters?. I mean, why charge the male with even more than the already idiotic ignorant loser just-sex looking personality you already gave him and give him also the shame of pursuing love in a ""closet charcter"".

Not expecting the next season at all."
"IMDb really needs to start allowing 1/2 star rating increments. This show is phenomenal plain and simple. 4 seasons in to what will end up being a total of 5 seasons, and all so far have been top notch television. Even season 2, which would be considered the weakest season, relatively, is still above average quality. Season 4 just wrapped up and it was an all out epic that would have sufficed as a suitable finale. I don't know what the Duffer Bros have in store to wrap it all up in season 5, but I do trust it will not disappoint."
"I am not sure who wrote season 4, but it had the best story telling in the entire series. The characters were smart and interesting, the plot was unpredictable, the pacing was perfect, and there were multiple highstakes events all happening at the same time..I really enjoyed this season."
"At first I thought it was series about teenage kids and was going to be them typical teenage series but in fact I found is great! You get to know the characters and really makes you build a bond for them. I thought it was going to be scary but surprisingly I could watch this well since it carries a good story line. It's got a great 80s vibe especially with the clothing! The last series was much more action and a few different story lines happening at once that drawers you right in! Gutted I've watched it all, now to wait for the next season!"
"I expected better than the mess that season three was. It could have been so much better.

This should have been about the kids versus the world. Not the kids versus each other. I hate how they used Hopper to create unnatural conflict between the kids. Perfect way to ruin the character who used to be my favorite.

Dividing the groups in genders was very cringy. Max and eleven should never be with each other. Max is a horrible character and never had any chemistry with Eleven.

""There's more to life than stupid boys"" -Max the mad maxi pad

That was max's way of ""enlightening"" Eleven.

Constant and Mindless banter and bickering involving Dustin with Erica, and Steve with Robin.

My little pony conversations? Seriously? And the Constant bickering between Erica and Dustin about who is more of a nerd.

This horrible dialogue took me out of the moment and ruined all suspense.

Dustin singing never ending story was horrible. It was so unbearably out of place and long. The song isn't the problem, the problem is that the song felt like it would never end, and was so poorly placed. Singing while people are dying is what this cheesy disaster of a show has turned into.

I can't believe anybody actually liked this season after seeing that!

This show was supposed to be a deep science fiction drama series. Not a useless cringe-inducing and shallow sitcom.

Having Robin come out as a lesbian was so unnecessary. Why not put effort into making the dialogue serve the plot instead of showing that you're culturally sensitive? Stop trying to use an 80's themed show to fix the past or something. Just stop. Robin never fit in with the other characters anyway.

Why are the Russians there and trying to open the gate?

Why was this season a useless redo of what we already saw except with more useless bickering and cheesy Russian costumes?

Maybe we are expected to watch season 4 to find out, but I have lost all interest."
"In Stranger Things we follow a tight knit group of youngsters in the '80's who encounter things that are not of this world. Still having flexible minds, they are the only ones able to get to the bottom of the frightening mysteries, and they do so with flair plus a whole lot of funny bickering.

I cannot begin to describe how well executed this series is. First of all, it is a brilliant depiction of the period itself, catching the electricity that was in the air at that time with music, looks, color and genius set design. It also catches the film-vibe of the period, where emotions were captured sharply, crystal clear and often a little exaggerated. The effect is incredible: a series with all the boons of modern-day filming that catches the electric vibe of another era.

What we get is best described as a mix of Spielberg, David Lynch, Ridley Scott and Stephen King at the height of their powers. From the typical Spielberg conversations where people yell things without listening, to vistas similar to Twin Peaks, music that could've come from Bladerunner and a monster plot that feels like Stephen King himself came up with it... everything is in there.

But the best part of the series is the character progression. Rarely have I seen a series introduce so many characters so well, and give them such interesting growth. You'll learn to love those you've hated two episodes ago, and vice versa. This means the show is filled to the brim with unexpected plot twists, never skips a beat and had me on my toes the entire time. The result is a show that is much scarier than it ought to be: you are so invested in its characters that every bit of danger they get into will feel like a paper cut.

From it's opening theme to its great acting, to its constant flow of quips, and undeniable tension with the highest stakes possible, Stranger Things is among the very top tear of shows. It easily walks alongside Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and well, Twin Peaks for that matter, with just a dash of E. T. splashed over it for good measure.

Although it may seem to be catered to a younger audience, it really isn't. It treats its youngsters as adults, something that was common in the '80's but seems lost too often in these times. It's all the better for it. So, don't deprive yourself of this one, the opening theme alone will make it worthwhile.

Go watch. Now."
"My cousin watched this show, and she constantly BEGGED me to watch it as well, so I did. And to tell the truth, I didn't expect it to be so good. The engaging storyline, the attractive characters, the effects---all incredible. My favorite season was season 4, (of course). This show always has you at the edge of your seat, and I can't wait for season 5!! I love how it includes lesbian and gay main characters! The environment around the characters perfectly captures the 80's, and the characters all have so much chemistry with eachother! The show contains the perfect balance of horror and romance! Amazing!"
The producers and director of this season should be ashamed of themselves.
"Season one was great, season two was reasonable, season three is just terrible. The level of writing is about the level of 3rd graders at best. It's just obnoxious that they try to pass this off as quality entertainment."
"This show is very enjoyable and I can't wait for season 4. Season 1 starts of the show at a 10/10 absolutely perfect with great characters hooking me and many others from the start. Season 2 is almost as good at a 8/10 but this season has the worst episode in the show, it is just painful. Season 3 again is great at a 9/10 I think I enjoy it a bit more than most people, but this season is the most ""This show is in the 80s"" thing about the show but still great."
"Let me start by saying I didn't have any high expectations for this new season. I knew this season would need to start an entire storyline from scratch and that there would be repetitive elements. So once I watched it, I was saddened to the extreme that my once beloved TV show took such a predictable turn. It's been 2 days since it aired and I still cannot believe what I just watched. This season completely lacked its sense of originality which we all loved from its prior 2 seasons. The plot was a literal copy of the second season ( monster -> closing the gate) with just more ""funny"" dialogue which was completely unnecessary. It really reduced the show to an over dramatic comedy show. The once great characters were all so unbearable to watch. The only interesting characters were Will, Robin and Dustin this season. So much of the plot was so annoyingly stupid that I couldn't believe the Duffer brothers came up with something like that. They left so many important questions (the Russians) carelessly unanswered just for the sake of progressing the story; which had no real depth. Even as a massive fan I had hoped they would've ended the show at s2 instead of prolonging it. Because clearly they are no longer capable to produce a season that could ever match up to their first. I don't have the slightest clue how they can pull off a S4, part of me doesn't even want to know because of this season's sheer disappointment. Honestly I could go on and on about how many aspects of this season I disliked. But I just can't be asked rn, just needed to vent. I hope this show learns from DARK, a masterpiece of a show which beams with originality and consistent writing. For all these reviewers who say this show is worth 10/10. Go watch DARK and you'll change your mind."
"Hope you have read the official storyline.

One of the most beautiful things about this story is that it is set in the 80s. Its just like watching it 30 yrs back, not something that was made now and made to look old (I hope you get what I mean). Only difference (but really appreciated), is the beautiful HD (and no grainy crap too).

The characters are so reminiscent of the Enid Blyton kids who solve mysteries - their true friendship, need to help and adventurous spirit, all make you truly fall in love with them. And into this comes in a beautiful girl (not talking about prettiness), for whom you really feel love and compassion. And then there are the teenagers and adults all of whom in their own way bring out the various feelings inside us.

Basically its the characters that make this show great. The good storyline, pacing, editing, etc., give these characters a solid framework to take us on an adventure. And you don't have to wait each week, forgetting the story and loosing the touch. The entire thing was released together (8 episodes, 6 hrs), so we can finish the story at a go.

The story itself is quite simple - Battling alien like monsters from an alternate universe. They could have easily done a 1.5 hr movie, but this longer version is nicer because it gave us a chance to meet these interesting people and spend a longer time with them. I was really sad to see it end. The way it ended, I think there could be a 2nd season. The ending was also a little sad, and I am hoping the 2nd season may have a solution.

Quality is on par with Mr.Robot, Person of Interest, etc., so I can easily recommend it to you.

Hope I could give you an idea about what to expect. Cheers...

PS: It is so happy to see kids who don't have ipads. Kids who loved to use their imagination and who loved to cycle out in the open over long distances. I could feel their freedom and free spirit..............."
"If your thinking about watching this show you definitely should. It's funny , emotional, entertaining and one of the most bingeable shows there is.

Season 1 9.4/10 A great season of television. The music, writing and acting were amazing. Every character were amazing ( except for Steve but he gets better) . This season never disappoints.

Season 2 9.6/10 This season was as good as the first and brought some great new characters, max and Bob , also bringing some great relationships , max and Lucas, Nancy and Jonathon, Joyce and Bob , and Steve and Dustin great and entertaining season which I couldn't stop watching and has turned into one of the best seasons on Netflix.

Season 3 8.8/10 I was worried about this season, there wasn't much left they could do, and the first 3 episodes weren't that great. But the 5 episodes after that were all fantastic episodes. It was funny and sad at the same time . It had a very sad death and really didn't disappoint and the show contains the level it had from the beginning, unlike a lot of Netflix originals."
"So, this show is nothing like i have ever seen before. They way they wrote the characters is amazing. Everyone plays a role in something. There are many people in this show and each one of them has some sort of role that they play when it comes to helping each other out. If someone is in trouble one character might come in and save them and at the same time while that is going down two other ones are turning something important off and stopping the monster from the source. I love shows that do that making each one be important instead of hey they did this okay now they are done. No everyone has some sort of reasoning for being there and each one just as important as the last. Great show love how it is based in the 80's and not today. If you want something that is new and fresh give this show a watch today."
"Good story. I don't do spoilers all I will say is that the characters are interesting and funny. Robin played by Maya Hawke turned out to be one of my favorites. And I hope that on the music soundtrack that "" Stranger Things "" does for Siouxsie and the Banshees what it did for Kate Bush. "" Spellbound was one of the best songs of that era and a great way to close the show."
"I was really looking forward to season 3, because 1 and 2 were so good. They dealt with serious issues like kidnapping and the loss of a child, and honestly showed the truth of people's behavior. The stuff of great storytelling. Soul, mind and heart. Season 3 had a stupid, superficial cartoon-like tone completely losing the gravitas and dignity that made the show so good. There was 10x more CGI and 1/10th the soul. It was kind of heartbreaking. Instead of learning from shows like Supernatural that maintain their integrity and did a 15 (!) year run or ST Voyager, they lost the truth of their story. They knew better than to dumb down this show!"
"This show has pretty much everything in it and every aspect is don very well indeed.

I feel like a kid again watching this, it reminds me so much of that excitement I felt when watching Goonies for the first time, or Explorers, or Back to the Future, ET etc etc.

If you grew up in the 80's, you will likely love this. If you did not, you will still like it as it is such an amazing, well paced, interesting, funny and immersive experience with characters that you can really bond with.

It is a faithful 80's movie reproduction seen through modern eyes.

This show on it's own is worth a netflix subscription."
"Not in the direction I was hoping for.. So I've never written a review before and never had to change a rating, that's how disappointed I am. Loved s1 and s2 was epic, the story went deeper and darker so that's what I was expecting in s3. Instead I just watched a sh1tstorm of cliche after cliche, a mush of cold war style evil russians, a russian terminator, an area 51 type conspiracy theorist, baywatch, back to the future and a neverending cringe story, that was not original or entertaining whatsoever. Dialogue and characters deserve one big facepalm. Why not rather explain what the upsidedown is, what is it that the demogorgan/mind flayer wants exactly? or at least explain why the russians wanted to reopen the gate? No. We learn absolutely nothing new. Nothing makes any sense. No incentive to look forward to a new season. So good bye stranger things, it was nice to know you but it's time to move on.."
"GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THE SHOW: This show is just amazing in every way possible. The way it combines the 80's and Horror without being cheesy is just groundbreaking on its own.. but it has likeable characters, such as Eleven, Steve, Mike, Dustin, Robin, etc. And also delves into trauma and The Upside Down is a very creative way to show us a backwards Dimension of our own. It's fun, sad, heartbreaking, tragic, happy, joyful, scary, horrific and everything else.

VOLUME ONE OF S4: The Darkest, Goriest Season to date became my personal favourite season. It explores every single one of our characters and what they are going through after the events of Season Three. The Scenes with Hopper in the Russian Prison are heart-shattering and there is one conversation he has with a character in the Season that will melt your heart. And we explore the past and trauma of Eleven in flashback scenes that are so brutal, and Vecna.. the villain.... oh my gosh! Easily the best villain we've gotten in Stranger Things so far. He is intense, malicious, evil and at the same time... human. You feel his emotions and the twist that happens with the character in the Season is shocking, though it makes sense. We see all of our characters split up, and though a lot of people didn't like that... I really enjoyed it. Cutting back to every one of the storylines through the movie-length episodes was always great! The deaths are gruesome, the characters are great... this Season was a total win for Netflix and fans of ST. Can't wait for the final two episodes in July!

VOLUME TWO OF S4: This is perfection from Start to Finish. Thrilling, gory, exciting, and emotional. I will not drop any Spoilers here.. but there is a scene with a character that dies that breaks you from the Inside Out. All the storylines mash together and it's just an amazing time! This is the best TV has been for a long time. That's all I can manage to say right now... holy moley."
What happened? Wow. It's painful. S3 brought my rating from 9 to 1. So bad.
"Season 1 was incredible. Season 2 after was passable, but not nearly as good. But season 3 however, it almost feels like a parody, everything about it is just off and it so blatantly misses what made the first season great."
"Season 1 was amazing. The story was robust and characters had reason to be in the show. It conveyed the 80s feeling with a good blend of 80s music.

Season 2 was good. The main story line was solid still although there were some questionable parts to it. Some characters were cheap and not well developed.

Season 3 was garbage. It seemed like the writers were tasked to see what people liked about the show and just fill the story line with them. It had excessive use of brands. The 80s music were just injected every where for no reason: every time a person entered the scene, 80s music was blasting loudly. Dialogs were extremely predictable and cheesy. Each character's personality was unnecessarily exaggerated: Hopper is always angry and unreasonable, Erica was constantly sassy but the smartest person ever, the mayor is the worst person in the world, the whole newspaper crew were excessively mean. And finally, the whole plot with the Russians was cheap and not at all well thought out. It was hard to finish the season really."
"All of it is the same generic cliche crap every single time, I haven't watched a movie in 5 months this year and I haven't watched a new show in idk how long cause season 3 is a perfect explanation of what's wrong with tv/movies and I'm glad everyone else agrees that season 3 is horrible."
Season 1 was great and much on point was season 2. Season 3? I can't even following. The plot lines are so disjointed. I had to force myself to watch past the first episode hoping for the original vibe to return. Fail. Would not recommend. I will not be continuing on with this series. Netflix is just a garbage provider releasing titles just for numbers. I've cancelled my membership. Nothing more worth watching anymore.
"Stranger Things, a fantastic and emotional series, plays with your feelings and when you least expect it, something shocking happens, leaving you with the feeling of seeing the next episode.

The first chapter: The Vanishing of Will Byers is boring and leaves you with the feeling that this series is not as exciting as everyone says, but if you give episode 2 a chance, it immediately grabs you.

Although it has some moments where nothing important happens, they are just preparing you for the big moment, the end of each episode leaves you speechless.

Its monsters are disturbing and grotesque, and season 4 surpassed the previous ones in brutality and left fans impatient for volume 2.

Each character is unique and you either immediately love or hate them, but don't get too attached a great series that I hope has a good ending, I hope that STRANGER THINGS 5 is as good as the other 4 seasons."
This keeps getting better year after year. They throwbacks are amazing. The storytelling is EXCELLENT. The cast is EXCELLENT. This is a show that needs more seasons!
"Ah, Stranger Things. How is it so damn good? There are so many ways in which this show could've gone wrong, but somehow it just keeps on delivering. It's a gigantic homage to the cultural mileu of the 80's, made with a huge amount of genuine affection for the period and everything that came with it, but others have tried and failed when the love just wasn't enough. Think John Carter, for example. I happen to quite like it, but it's certainly flawed, despite the fanboy enthusiasm of its director. The amusingly named Duffer Brothers have tapped effortlessly into the zeitgeist of what it meant to be a teenager in the 80's. The music, the clothes, the entertainment, and more pop culture references woven into the fabric of the plot than you can shake a stick at. It could (perhaps ought) to have fallen flat on its face, but I find it impossible to fault.

The cast are great, from young to adult. I don't know where Winona Ryder has been, but her performance in this as a distraught mother driven to the edge of sanity reminds me what we've been missing from her for too long. Millie Bobby Brown has used her role in ST to propel herself to pretty much global stardom at a very young age. She is so good, she could probably carry the show on her own if she had to.

Some people might say the plot is massively derivative of so many films and perhaps a few TV shows from the period, and of course it is - that's the whole point. It wouldn't be much of an homage to the 80's if it wasn't. It's the carefully considered blending of those elements into a vaguely cohesive whole which is critical to its success. So really I suppose what they have done is transport us back to a certain kind of American 80's, with specific antennae for the things that interested them, and if you're not on board I suppose you might not really recognize it as your 80's at all. But hey, it's certainly familiar to me, despite the fact I'm not American, and I like it A LOT!

Oh, and by the way, it does not lose the plot and become all 'woke' and whatever after season 1. What a load of ordure. If you're invested in the characters, rather than just skimming along the surface with the basic storyline, I fail to see why you would lose interest along the way."
"*NO SPOILERS* Since I don't think I can write a review on each season, I will make a review for each season in this one review, starting with Season 1, of course. (Also expect a lot of typos because I'm tired and this review is over 1000 words long)

(TLDR for each rating of each season at the end of the review)

Season 1: An unexpected hit

The start of the show. The set up for what's to come, and it's the second best season of the show. The atmosphere is creepy and unsettling, but it's not all too grim as actually funny humor is able to prevent the show from becoming too bleak. The plot is simple and easy to follow, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to be overly simple. Simple plots aren't always a bad thing, and this is a great example. The mystery builds up throughout the show making you wonder what the truth is, and it keeps you second guessing yourself. The acting is superb, and that's a common trend throughout the show. Almost all of the characters are likeable and don't feel one dimensional. The buildup is slow and it works. It doesn't feel drawn out, and nothing feels like it's meant to be filler. Everything feels like it has a purpose in the grand scheme of things. The tension is really good even though majority of the protagonists are children and you doubt anything bad is going to happen to them. The cgi is a bit rough when the Demogorgon is shown in full feel, but aside from some other problems this season is amazing. An easy 9/10.

Season 2: More of the same

So much hype. And for some it lived up to that hype, but for others this season failed to meet expectations and was disappointing. I can't fully say if it lived up to the hype for me because when Season 2 started, I started Season 1. But even though this Season has flaws, which we'll talk about, it's still fun and enjoyable, and adds to the foundation of Season 1. This Season had 2 big standout flaws. First, it felt like too much like a rehash of the first season, and 2nd, the ""The Lost Sister"" episode. Starting with the first big flaw, I think it's a fair criticism. Once again Will is the target of the villain, but instead of the villain being the Demogorgon we get a brand new big bad, The Mind Flayer. An interesting villain, and something we see turn into a very big character throughout the show, but let's not get side tracked. Nothing really in this Season felt different from the first aside from a couple of new characters. Those characters are, Max, and Billy. Both are great characters and play big roles in the show. But the reason this Season still isn't hated or viewed extremely negatively is because the first Season had such a winning formula that fans weren't unhappy with more of the same, and I understand that. But no amount of good formula can save the episode titled, ""The Lost Sister."" What a terrible episode. It added very little to the story, was boring, had uninteresting characters, and felt unnecessary. We could have gone without this entire episode and the show would be the same. But this Season overall was still pretty fun, and enjoyable. Overall, it's a 7.5/10.

Season 3: Oh boy where do I start?

Ugh... This season. It could have been really good. That might be one of the worst parts about this season. The visuals, colors, and vibe was great, but nearly everything else was not. The story makes no sense. I'm just going to get that out of the way now. Massive plot holes. It's the 80s and no one in a small town in Indiana notices the massive Russian base underneath the very popular mall. How? Who knows? The design of this base is terrible too. Why does it look like it was ripped out of a canceled Spy Kids movie? The plot wasn't very interesting either. The whole ""Flayed"" plot was boring and uninteresting. The way the ""Flayed"" act is so dumb and unoriginal. They're basically zombies! The Hopper and Joyce storyline wasn't very good, and Alexi is an overrated and a lazy character. Giving a character one trait that makes them ""funny"" doesn't count as a character. And the humor is also pretty bad. Little jokes are funny, and the jokes happen too much. It also has a Terminator knockoff for no reason, and the entire story is extremely predictable. The massive tonal shifts don't help this already mediocre season. Whos idea was it to have a ""funny"" comic relief scene cut to a torture scene? It's so out of nowhere. This season isn't all bad, and it introduces one of my favorite characters, Robin, but the cons outweigh the pros, by a lot. The final episode isn't too bad though.

Sadly, this Season is a 5.5/10.

Season 4: Back on track baby!

This Season is great! It has the best moments of the show, best episodes, best villain, best story, best mystery, best action, and best cgi. Also the best soundtrack. This season starts off slow, and has the longest episodes of the series, each being at least an 75 minutes long. The tension is high in this Season, and so is the fun. Max gets a great character arc, and Vecna, the new big bad, is the best villain of the show. His origin and story is so interesting, and his way of killing his victims is... Chilling to say the least. I feel like I could talk about this Season forever so I'll keep each topic short-ish, but this Season tops Season 1. It brings back the perfectly timed humor and exciting mystery but cranks those up to 11 (no pun intended.) The episodes don't feel overstuffed either, instead they take their time, and build things up slowly. Even though all of our main characters are split up around the world, each group's story feels fleshed out and well balanced with the others. The best story is the Hawkins story, but each has their own pros and cons. This Season also introduces an amazing new character, Eddie. This dude rocks! What a great character. So likeable, but he isn't just in the show for comic relief. This season is also the most intense of the series, and has the best writing in my opinion. Season 4 was split up into 2 parts/volumes and it really only built hype. We didn't have to wait long for Volume 2, and the ending of Volume 1 was great. The acting from the old cast, and the new, is the best of the series, and overall amazing. The visual effects hit an all new high and the high budget was worth it. This Season tops the first, and is the best of the show. 9.8/10

Overall this show is amazing, and even if not all the Season are top tier, its still a classic, and I can't wait for Season 5.

TLDR: Season 1: 9.0/10 Season 2: 7.5/10 Season 3: 5.5/10 Season 4: 9.8/10."
"Ohh Dear! Marvellous Experience with this brilliant show, Earlier I binge watched it's 1st and 2nd season 3/4yrs ago I guess, then season 3 came and it's ending was just perfect except hopper one. But I noticed a similar pattern in these 3 seasons about creatures appearing in every season and in the end defeated by bunch of genius kids. Same pattern continuing over first 3 seasons. But But But here in this season 4 the antagonist creature is in human for with human vocals so we got instantaneous attach with this character and fear as well. Season 4 is basically the darkest season of this series till now with this new (basically main villain) Creature. Now this villain is bit powerful and can harm main characters as well. Now our protagonist kids are mature and grown ups ; so their childish behaviors also gone especially Dustin's! Overall a great experience with Season 4 ; I'll desperately wait for Season 5 Now."
What can I say? Season 3 was like a parody of the other two seasons. Complete woke nonsense. Russians with unexplained motivations. Jokes at all the wrong times. Horrible characterization. Woke sjw nonsense everywhere. Don't waste your time with this season I'm sorry I did.
"I didn't watch this previously, as I thought it is children show. Why would I bother to watch despite it's high rating? But as soon as I started watching, I coundn't stop myself. I watched the 3 season within 4 days. Even I watch it twice. One in English and another in hindi dubbed with my siblings. They liked it too and is kinda hocked up with it.

One thing that I don't like is the the kissing scene between Mike and Eleven, they are just too young. However, rest are are amazinggg...I'm eagerly waiting for it's 4th season. It is getting postponed again and again sadly :))"
"Season one was low budget, but managed to entrance us with the intriguing tale of a young girl with super powers who escapes from a government experiment into the lives of three boys in Hawkins, Indiana.

We are introduced to an alternate dimension- the Upside Down, where evil monsters lurk and seek to enter ours. The story is full of 80's nostalgia and Easter eggs, with plenty of laughs, scares, and kids overacting and talking like grown ups.

Season 2 continued the story with the endlessly entertaining Sean Astin, and a road trip for our main character. We finally learn about Eleven's family, and those around her at the government prison.

Season 3 is a stinky, wet gym sock. The Duffer brothers gave up all attempts of writing a coherent story, and simply went through the paces of action/horror movie tropes with no regard for plot holes. Eleven's powers conveniently weakens during encounter to put her group in mortal danger. The contrived scenes of a foreign invasion under a suburban mall in Indiana is not believable. There are saving graces like Terminator references by the main villain and nonstop period appropriate jokes, but no enough to save it.

It's too bad season 3 is only 4 stars. It dragged down a nearly perfect series into just above average territory. I will let my kids watch season 4 first before risking 6 hours of my life."
"It should have ended in Season 1. What upsets me the most is that I will never get my time back I spent watching S3. Proves one more thing: if you run out of ideas, bring in the Russians portrayed as halfwits, vodka soaked and always inferior. What a cliché. Acting is 70's television theatrical. Was it supposed to be a comedy then, or sifi or drama? A jack of all trades is a master of none. 2 first episodes could have been squeezed in 5 mins. Medley of overplayed 80s songs that directors were trying to stick into any available space between product placements. Now imagine there were no seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 would not have gone past the pilot. No awards material here."
"I thought this series was fun until... the third season. What happened? Why did it get stupid as a Disney production? After what happened to Game Of Thrones, I'm not surprised anymore. But it's still disappointing. I won't be following it anymore."
"Stranger Things: Season 4 returns with the cast divided.with Wyona Ryder and Brett German headed to Russia to free Hooper (David Harbour) from prison. In the meantime Eleven played by Millie Bobby Brown is taken back to a secret bunker in Nevada to try to revive her powers. The rest of the gang is back in Hawkins where a series of student deaths led to Vecna trying to open a portal to bring the up side down to our world. The team ends up spending most of the time in realm of evil to try to stop the wrong side from escaping. Each of the episodes felt as though you are watching a movie, each of them were as long as if not longer than most other series. Eleven learns about her past and how she came to use her powers and put Vecna/Henry/Number one to the other realm. The storyline brings the team together to try to help Max from being taking over by Vecna to open the fourth and final doorway to the upside down. Overall great series but the directors would not harm or kill off any of the main charters of the show, there were too many characters to name and new ones added this year.. Season 5 will be the final season and can't wait to see how it ends. Definitely add this to your list."
"S4 of Stranger things has matured along with the show. It is actually violent, at times genuinely horrifying and fun all at the same time. While some of the acting is minorly subpar, it is met with fantastic acting, brilliant looking shots, awesome makeup and practical effects, a great sound choice for every scene and a convincing bad guy. It deals with the vast amount of characters really well by sectioning them off into 3 different groups which gives us refreshing moments when maybe we spend too much time with a certain group. This season wasn't absolutely perfect, there was very minor things but there isn't quite enough to derail the show. This season (1st volume) is by far the best they have produced. As a season this is easily a 9/10 and a series of an 8/10. As long as they stick the landing and volume 2 lives up to the first, this will easily be a 9/10 series. It's a long watch but I highly recommend it and it is a show I would even recommend getting Netflix for at this point.

Volume 2- Only two episodes but basically a shorter movie and a long movie worth of content. Volume 2 pick up right where volume 1 left... as you would expect. I feel like the new more mature version of Stranger things that volume 1 brought kind of went away mostly. While there's some stuff there, I feel like they loaded this with plot armor and a wanted to make sure of a season 5. It almost feels originally this would be the last season but then volume 2 was their way of ensuring there would be another season. I'm not sure why they chose to shy so far away from the mature side, especially how well it worked in volume 1 but this was a drag at times and underwhelming to say the least. One more season to go, all I can do is hope they listen to the reception with volume 1 and show a pair with their characters for once. I'm so tired of the gotcha's. Volume 2 is a 7/10

Keeping the series at S1- 8/10 S2- 8/10 S3 7/10 S4V1- 9/10 S4V2- 7/10

Series total- 8/10."
Season one was great. Season 2 was ok. Season 3 shows they lost the mojo. Don't even care if I see season 4.
"Wow! My wife & I watched (slow binge-watched) the 3 seasons in about a week & a half, catching 3 episodes most nights. It had us at the first episode. Being with these people so much makes me feel as though we formed a bond, & the strange thing is, I'm really missing them the day after. Gonna be difficult to wait so long for the next season. For the people writing that the series went from great to good to bad: maybe you have a problem with your attention span, or get bored being around the same people for extending periods of time. Stick to video games."
"So I watched of of Series 3 over a weekend (I also watched all of Series 1 and some of 2 earlier.) I can only say that I should have done something else because S3 was so awfully disappointing and boring. Here are my reasons.

1. Lack of a story. So mysterious monster/s decide without any purpose to invade the small town of Hawkins through a subterranean gate. At the same time, Russians try to open the gate, despite knowing that monsters lie on the other side.

2. Sarcastic bickering. In almost all character groupings, they bicker sarcastically, sometimes for minutes on end. I fast-forwarded many of these without any loss to the story. Since none of these bickering episodes add to the story, they are wasted time. It was almost as though the scriptwriters thought, ""Oh! We have a conversation here! Let's have the characters not say anything important that might add to the story. Let's make them bicker instead!"" In fact, one of the characters even says at one point (perhaps an ad lib?) ""Please stop bickering!""

3. Random illogical story-slowing scenes. There are several of these, but this is the most stupidly nonsensically random and unnecessary one. So two characters apparently have to sing a song to each other before one will give a vital bit of info that will save the world. Sorry?

4. Nostalgia vs Story. Yes, the 80s nostalgia was good, but Story always comes first. Drive the story forward with straight, clear direction. Let the Nostalgia support the story, not the other way around.

5. Pacing. I don't mind a slow start if I know it is going to be rewarded somehow. Yet S3 took two episodes before there was any hint of a story. TWO EPISODES! In screen time, that is almost two hours! Sorry, but a story should give its viewers/readers/listeners some idea of its direction and purpose MUCH earlier than that.

6. Ripoffs from other movies. I have not seen many of the movies that other reviewers have mentioned, but it appears that there were several tropes and elements from 80s movies that ST drew from. That is all very well, but Story MUST at all times come first. ST had enough going for it in S1 to be original. It is very sad that it simply became a bland blancmange of other movies in S3 than a standout of its own.

7. Predictable There was only one surprise in the whole series, and it came right at the end. Pretty well everything else was signposted. As a result, I skipped over considerable sections.

8. Stupidities !Spoilers ahead!

* So why did Hopper just look at Joyce instead of running back inside the safe room where she was? It was only a few steps, and he had the time. * So why didn't anyone check on Planck's Constant before they went on the rescue mission? * So what was the purpose of My Little Pony? You sorta expect that characters will be fully focussed on saving the world, not bickering about why a kids backpack has this cartoon figure on it.

9. Cliches abound. S1 was pretty good in terms of cliches, The scriptwriters restrained themselves and produced something pretty tightly scripted and directed. S3, on the other hand, wallowed in a glut of cliches, too many to list here.

Summary. This had the potential to really shine. However, it is best suited to those who want a mindless, poorly written, unoriginal time-waster. For those looking for a decent, original, thought-provoking, tense, surprising series, look elsewhere. This is most certainly NOT what you are looking for."
"Really, I have never felt the need nor was inspired to write a review, like, never ever, and from the height of my age and as a one that saw a lot of great productions, this one was outstanding, to say the least. There is something unique about this series that it's hard to explain... It's a mixture of different things that combines into a nothing less than pure joy and pleasure. I have binged through the whole 3 seasons in a few days w/o being able to stop...and enjoyed each and every single episode w/o any exceptions. The story, acting, visual effects, 80s atmosphere, suspense, music, jokes, rythem... I felt as if all of these were redefined in this series, resulting in an utterly overwhelming fun that kept me glued to the screen... Asking for more and more...note that English is not my mother tongue so I really having a hard time finding the right words to describe the experience... I really hope some of it managed to pass through... THIS WAS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!"
"First two seasons were great, but, this third season was duff. The final episode was particularly duff, I'm hoping they leave it at that. It was so silly, Russians managing to build a giant complex under an Indianan mall and people it with hundreds of soldiers and scientists as well as all the equipment. Oh, come on! As someone who was a young person in 1985 I felt no sense of nostalgia, in fact it felt like I was watching on of those duff American kids versus evil Russians movies like Iron Eagle. Not good. As for Dustin singing 'Never ending Story' I ended up cringing and fast forwarding through it, a silly waste of time that didn't work. And don't get me on to the corrupt mayor, such a caricature."
"Stranger Things is undoubtedly one of the best series in history , all of the actors act with very high chemistry, every scene is done perfectly from every perspective. Its so good that its going to be so rare for the viewer to be distracted by other things, the story never gets boring, its so good that i cant even say wich season is the best. I really wish i can wake up someday forgetting what happened in the series so i can watch it all again."
"If I had to choose, I would prefer season 3 to the other 2 seasons. This series isn't overrated, but it's really good. Cinematography, CGI, Music, the Actors, everyone! Perfect."
I will go right on the point they ran out of ideas for the story ... because the story for this season is really bad and kinda repeated story and the mystery element we used to like in this show is gone in this season
"Title says it all. Season 3 had no story line and it felt like it was thrown together. It looked like it was rushed just to get it out. Not waste you time watching season 3, you have already seen it in season 1&2"
"Two seasons was good enough. Did their best to stretch out the ""story"" into 8 episodes and make a full season, but this could have been a 1.5 hour movie and be done with it. Just another Netflix series to take up my time, instead of entertainment."
"First, why does IMDB not allow you to rate a specific season? Season 1 was a solid 9. It's been downhill ever since. My rating for this review applies solely to season 3.

When I saw Ars Technica deem season 3 ""the show's best season yet,"" my nasal cavity was immediately cleansed by the purifying power of Dr. Pepper. What a garbage take. Season 3 is by far the worst, and it's not even close. The Duffer Bros mailed this one in. My audible groans during the 8 episodes were legion. Bones of contention, in no particular order:

Hopper and Joyce have become manic cartoon representations of their former selves. When they aren't shrieking at each other, they're...oh, wait, that's all they do this season is shriek at each other. Completely unhinged and overacted. I wanted to slap them both back to sanity.

The ""subterranean-Bond-villain fortress full of uniformed Russian soldiers in the heartland of Indiana"" is simply laughable. When did Stranger Things become Austin Powers?

The kid characters have passed their sell-by date. They've lost the adorable charm of yesteryear's youth and are now just grating teens.

How many years will it take Eleven to learn to speak English without sounding like a 6-year-old halfwit? Come on, we're in season 3 and she's still enunciating her words syllable-by-syllable with a baffled look on her face like she's learning Mandarin???

Haircuts: I was a young teen in the 80s. Guys that age at that time honestly did not wear bowl haircuts. Will and Mike look ridiculous. Ugh.

Also, believe it or not, there were competent barbers in the 80s. We're looking at you, Jonathan.

The Terminator-esque Russian soldier was just cringeworthy. A bridge too far here, guys.

To outdo the addition of the Most Annoying New Character from season 2 (Max), they outdid themselves in season 3 with The Even More Annoying New Character (Erica). Someone please stick a fork in my ears!

The mall battle was stupid. The end.

An absurd plot, annoying characters, hysterical acting, and tepid attempts at 80s references (and fashion choices) make season 3 a complete disappointment. This story ran out of juice long ago, but Netflix will certainly try squeezing more blood from the turnip. I wish I hadn't spoiled the memory of my utter joy from season 1 by watching this steaming pile of dreck."
"SO annoying. The only good thing was the music, beyond that it is un watchable. Russians? Really? So STUPID....."
"First season was an absolute relief from the all-formulaic, know-what-comes-next, predictable shows around, some of them successful and welcome to an extent, but we're always looking forward to the ""next big show"".

Stranger things had it. Or at least, it looked like it did. Season one definitely kept us all wanting more and it was a long wait for the continuation, then it started going downhill but adding the same formulas the show appeared to stray away from (which was the best thing of the show)

Season two, if there was nothing more from the writers of the show, should have found a satisfying finale, since Season three has not offered just more of the same, but taken it to new grounds of clichés, taking very little advantage from a great cast enssemble which they should have cared more for, and the writers should have at least looked to deliver what the cast itself deserved.

Unfortunately, the show simply took a nosedive. Less likeable actors were brought into the mix since season two, and we kept waiting for the plot point where they would prove the cast was perfect and that they had something up their sleeves. None of this happened. Yet, the audience was forgiving. Hey, there might be some great growth and development for season three, right? Wrong again. Those two characters being Max and Billy, well, they had no reason to be in the show, it's like they needed some wildcards so they could throw any save-the-cat kind of writing moments into the show, not because they were planned, but because they had done exactly the opposite: not planned anything at all.

The more I write the more I feel ""nostalgic"" about the first season. That being the main reason the show did well in the first season: Playing with nostalgia. But once you make it the strong part of a show, with the actors coming second, and the screenwriting taking a third, even a fourth or even fifth place in priorities, well, it even makes you be grateful that such a sweet era like the eighties, has passed.

Season 3 is a collage of ""why don't we add some russians into the mix.... why don't we make it more gory.... why don't we give them an alien instead invasion of the body snatchers...? ... why don't we ..."" until we as viewers are like : Why don't we just forget about the show, and let it go down in the glory it once had.

Such a shame. They were onto something good. Now instead, they've made any films or shows that use that nostalgia from the 80s be something, well, redundantly, old. I look forward to any content that has the actors that were a part of the show since season one (from the second season, meh, I wouldn't care if they're simply forgotten, they've given their all, and their all just turned out to be straight-up mediocre)"
"This is my first review because I really needed to say something for this once great series. Don't get me wrong, I loved seasons 1 and 2 because of the great acting, cinematography, plot, writing, character development and action and even the monster was good. Season 3 was almost the opposite.

I think what happened is that they ran out of ideas or got new writers. Everything feels forced and cliché. The acting is still great but the characters are put into environments where they don't fit or they have already tried it on and there's no reason for them to try it on again. The show feels like it lost it's soul due to the cost of charm and comedy.

The plot runs thin and dialogue is mostly cringe (the Coke product placement is...ugh). There are too many side plots and the characters don't feel like the characters much. I knew immediately from the first episode that something was off, it was too teen romance and relationships, Hopper's character did a complete 360. I get that they grew up/ moved on/ changed but something still feels weird.

The ending was a bit emotional but I still don't get the generic Russians plot, it wasn't anything original. How could they get away with making a huge bunker under a big mall?

Overall, it feels like I'm watching a low budget comedy/thriller monster movie which is a parody of the show with decent acting and I am so disappointed. I really hope the Duffer brothers step it up and pull out their magic in season 4 because I know that magic from season 1 is somewhere in there."
"Season 3 is so poor, give up with this show, I have"
"One of the best shows around. Awesome, creative story telling. Great rounded characters played by wonderful cast. Top notch GCI and effects. Perfect show that can be watched over and over."
"Very good series. Original, thrilling and full of action. Some great acting performances and some good chemistry between characters. The third series felt a bit of the same in places but was still really good, I think they need to end it next series with a good ending and it will be one of the best series of all time if they can do that."
"S04 - (9,7) The Duffer Brothers manage to bring new life into this series by turning it back into a dark mystery that ups the stakes like never before and creates a cohesive story through different storylines, while setting up what should be a thrilling final season."
This is show is one of the best shows ever. The last season is just amazing and I love it!! I hope that there wil be more seasons to watch in future. Also Joseph Quinn character in the show was amazing.
"It is not over yet.

This season is the best season of all in Stranger Things. Packed with stellar performances with powerful visuals and background score. Best Fantasy series you ever witness."
"Season 3 felt more like a parody than an ""normal"" season. I don't understand the hype about it, for me it was just MEH."
"Season 4 deliver on everything I hoped to see, even though the gruesomeness is sometimes a bit much. I love the old school vibe, characters and character development these guys go through!! Greatest series I have ever watched !!!!"
"Every season gets worse and worse, there's way too much filler now. I loved the first season but I should have known, like most shows, there is only one good season because the creators only really have plans for that one season and everything else is just a cash grab."
"With Hopper gone (he had time to leg it, why didn't he?), any new sequel is condemned. With storywriting like like this, who would want to replace him?"

Mix it together until nobody suspects plagiarism and you have got yourself a show which is simple enough that children can enjoy. It is a children's show with boring plotlines mixed in with cheap thrills. It is highly predictable with no real consequences to the primary characters. Everybody comes out safe and sound and only the secondary characters die. Stuffed with huge plot holes and nonsensical teenage drama this show is poor horror and even worse comedy. At no part you feel invested trying to guess the mystery. Although it does have its moments where it's mildly interesting. If that's your thing then all power to you."
"This show is really, really good.

It's the perfect show to watch in the summer. It gives you that, vibe...you know?

It's just so entertaining and ends on panic attack giving cliffhangers."
Can we just acknowledge that that Season 4 finale had some of the best writing of any TV show ever!? The way they add missing information to give context to things that literally happened in Season 1 is insane!!! EPIC SHOW!!! Literally one of the best out there. An apsolute MUST SEE!! I can't wait for Part 2 to come out. Once it ends I'm immediately going to rewatch everything now that I understand everything! Apsolutely INSANE!!! Thanks Duffer bros! What a vibe!
"As a 45 year old guy who grew up in the 80s, this show appealed to me, bringing back fond childhood memories of fashion, music, and a world without mobile phones or social media - bliss!

But what really sets this is the fantastic story and emotional connection you make with the characters.

Seasons 1-3 were brilliant, but for me, season 4 takes it to a whole new level. It has homages to the great horror films of the 80s (Nightmare on Elm street being the most famous). In season 4, we see a twist in the storyline, whereby the main villain has a face, and it makes all the difference. The scriptwriting is masterful, and the direction Spielbergesque.

Some of the scenes will be remembered for a long time, such as Max's narrow escape to the tune of Diana Ross, and 11's epic battle with 1, before she banished him to the upside down.

This is television of the highest quality, I feel myself getting emotional just thinking about it. 10/10."
One of the best shows I have ever seen. The acting is amazing the graphics and visuals are stunning. Lots of different emotions and you get very connected to each character. Nothing more needed.
"It's like being transported back to the 80s. One of the best shows to date on Netflix. Simply love it. Do yourself a favor and watch it. I was hooked from the first frightening episode and 4 seasons later, I'm still in love with it, the characters, the music, the mood, the head nods to all-things 80s, the friendships, the loyalty, the romance, the development of the actors. It's simply brilliant and incredibly satisfying."
"Season 4 poses on a fluent straight forward movement of the Stranger Things franchise, with a high action gory suspense with continuous story unfolding packed with high level of detail of characters, makes it a true watch till the end.. Criticism may come for the villain known as Vecna as it felt more like he was a more Of Talk- Then Show type villain yet Vecna""s origin story feels more deadly and satisfying and a lot of plot holes feel like they need to be covered for Season 5. Praise comes for the well written Storyline and plot, CGI and mostly giving an accurate dose of blood and action simultaneously to the different monsters and even by killing some some by characters ... Season 4 will be with no doubt the darkest season from all other 3 seasons, may the Duffer Brothers continue to make more shows like this."
"Every season of 'Stranger Things' seems like an elaborate suspense-thriller franchise film. It has its start-middle-end and a definite season closure, though leaving a subtle seed for the next season. The show very interestingly creates a sci fi world (particularly in Season 1) and then explores different elements of suspense, thriller, fantasy, action, drama, comedy, romance, bromance and also horror (in some portions) very smartly and keeps you riveted all through. Thankfully it never muddles or messes up with its multiple genres.

Each season follows a format where multiple tracks run in parallel from the very start until they merge together in the pre-climax and thereafter the group divides into smaller units to get set on one common mission in the finale. The format works perfectly for the show as it keeps its ensemble characters employed in different subplots and keeps you engaged with the variety. However, the editing pattern is so brisk that just when you expect to delve more into one particular track, the narrative erratically cuts into another plot and then another and then another. This happens largely in Season 2 and 3 and, at times, the pattern irritates. Another pattern is a match-cut transition from one scene to another which happens so often that it seems overdone. The pacing of the show is fast, not giving you any breathers to sit back and relax or analyse. Thankfully the makers have kept the flavour in true-blue suspense-thriller zone without making it a slow burn or dark drama.

Beyond the premise and promise of an imaginative world, Stranger Things largely works because of its varied colourful characters. Whether it is El, Hopper, Joyce, Nancy or the four friends - each one is unique and has an interesting part to play. Also each character is written so robustly that you cannot pick any one of them as the central protagonist or rate anyone as the supporting cast. This is one of the few shows (or perhaps the only show) where almost every character has equal weightage, not just in screentime but also in their contribution to the story and also how you keep rooting for each of them. Even characters who seem to be just the supporting cast in the start come to fore more prominently over seasons. The best example is of Steve Carrington who comes across as the typical evil campus guy in season 1 but turns more likeable eventually. So is Erica, Max or Billy!

The intrigue that was created in Season 1 dilutes down in Season 2 and 3 as you get more and more accustomed to the world. Season 3, in particular, stretches at times with an action track of a Russian mercenary chasing Hopper, resulting in some long-drawn-out action sequences in a fun-fair setup - something that seems forced and not in sync with the primary genre of the show. Then there is one break episode (Season 2, episode 7) that is just unconnected with the overall plot of the series and you aren't surprised when you see it is the lowest rated episode on IMDb. You could give this one a complete miss and still nothing would change in your viewing experience or story flow of the show.

The show is subtly set in the early 80s era and the period reference is never in your face. The narrative is so gripping that you never consciously notice the absence of cellphones or other modern gadgets. Every episode ends on a definitive hook point which wants you to keep going ahead. Despite having adult overtones of creature horror and verbal abuse, the show still palpably captures the innocence of childhood friendship in a very organic way."
"STRANGER THINGS (2016-???) is a worldwide phenomenon that will probably go down as Netflix's most popular and successful series. Netflix has a habit of cancelling shows early in their runs and almost never lets a series go past Season 3. But ST is so popular, there was no way they would dump it's cash cow that is probably a big reason many viewers keep their subscriptions. Word of mouth is that Season 5 will be the last, but you never know with a show this popular. At the very least, I could totally see spinoffs for popular characters happening. ST is a show that I actually decided to watch because everyone was saying how great it was and based on the first season, I agree. In a bubble, Season 1 of the show is one of the best things that came out in the 2010s, a perfect homage to the 80s. It very much felt lived in with authentic sets, locations, costumes and atmosphere the captured the early 80s. The town of Hawkins, Indiana felt like an authentic slice of life and the secret laboratory right out of an 80s horror movie.

There was some serious award-worthy acting going on in the first season, with Winona Ryder (Joyce), David Harbour (Hopper), and child phenom Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven/El/Jane) all garnering well deserved Emmy nominations for their excellent performances. Also, Noah Schnappe as Will deserved award consideration for Season 2. Finn Wolfhard as Mike made for a strong, compelling male lead as and leader of the pre-teen friend group as well as El's boyfriend. Mike and El had a great developing relationship in Season 1. Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin was a scene stealer. Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas was the reliable voice of reason for the group. The relationships built up between El and the quartet of boys formed the heart of Season 1. Unpopular opinion, but Season 2 was actually good, too, if a decrease in quality from the phenomenal first season. Rounding out the original cast was the teen love triangle of Jonathan (played by Charlie Heaton), Nancy (Natalia Dyer), and the extremely popular Steve (Joe Keery). Generally, the cast was solid except I found Lucas to be the worst acted character and I was never much a fan of Nancy, either. I kept wanting the actress to have a meal. Last but not least, Matthew Modine was exceptional as the creepy scientist ""Papa"" who raised El and the group spent the season trying to escape from. Which leads into the later seasons!

Season 2, while good overall, was a mixed bag due to the dubious addition of one of the show's most overrated and annoying characters Max (played by Sadie Sink). This character almost sank the show for me because Max felt so forced into the narrative and had zero chemistry with the established characters. Sink's acting left a lot to be desired always making bug-eyed faces to relay emotion and yelling her dialogue. Max was just kind of there and not given too much to do since she was useless. It seems like Max was added just to start balancing out the gender distribution as well as giving Lucas a girlfriend. The actual GOOD additions to the cast in Season 2 were Paul Reiser (as a sympathetic scientist), Sean Astin (as the lovable Bob), and especially Dacre Montgomery (as the troubled Billy). There was the one Chicago filler episode that everyone hated, but it was just a blip as the season finished strong.

Season 3 is where the show lost me. It was a full on parody of the 80s with too many nods to popular 80s output including Miami Vice, The Terminator, The Goonies, etc. Characters started acting out of character just shouting their dialogue at each other and dressing like an 80s music video. A small town in Indiana in the early 80s should NOT be caught up with the times and everyone dressing like they live in California. All of a sudden everyone had weird hairstyles and were aware they were in the 80s instead of just being in the 80s. Also, there was the addition of yet another annoying character Robin, an obnoxious, know-it-all, motormouth of a character that of course fans think is awesome! Also, there was this Murray character and I can't remember if he was introduced in Season 2 or 3. The only arc that was remotely good was Billy's redemption.

Season 4 is where I most oppose the popular opinion. The general fandom loves it, but I thought it was weak. There were too many subplots. I think there were legitimately about 10 different subplots! The characters had the WORST hairstyles and wigs. The cinematography was too bright and colorful. The new additions were forgettable and yeah, I'm including Eddie! For the life of me, I don't get why fans are so obsessed with this character, who looked 40 years old even though he was supposed to be a teenager in high school. Also, there was Argyle, a stoner who also looked 40. I just don't find any of these new characters with their awkward, goofy humor to be relatable. It feels like I'm watching the same goofball character all the time. Then there was the overrated Max arc because fans were chomping at the bit to finally have a reason to call this forced insert of a character the greatest thing ever. Basically, the writers had the doomed Max remember a few random scenes with characters she had no connection to or chemistry with and that is what saved her life. But I wasn't fooled by the manipulation. The Russian rescue plot with Hopper was boring, too. Then there was a retread of Nancy-Steve. Again, much like Season 3, there was one good arc/character and that was Peter, but much like Billy in Season 3, not enough screen time.

By Season 4, I was tired of the characters and their antics. Too many new (and overrated) characters like Eddie and Argyle introduced to the point that I no longer connected to or cared about any of the old characters, most of who are just kind of there. There ARE actually a few good characters like El, Will, and Erica, but they aren't enough to sustain what has become an incredibly bloated series with far too many characters. ""Funny"" characters like Robin and Murray are just plain annoying with all their weird quirkiness. Popular characters like Steve and Dustin had gotten tiresome. Nancy and Jonathan were pretty much always boring, both individually and as a couple. The show finally committed to the forced Joyce-Hopper pairing just because they are the main adults. Then there's all of the forced emotion from characters like Max and Lucas, who have all the chemistry and personality of 2 snails and played by actors who can't act their way out of a paper bag. I literally read people saying these actors should have gotten Emmy nominations for being sad and crying a lot and I'm like ""watch more shows!"" LOL The ONLY couple on this show that's worth anything is Eleven and Mike, which leads to Mike. Then Finn Wolfhard plain forgot how to act or he just doesn't care anymore since he knows the show is ending. Millie Bobby Brown and Noah Schnapp are the only 2 legitimate young actors of the cast because I can tell that their talents will transcend this show. The rest of them will probably be forever typecast and shoehorned into roles similar to the ones on the show.

Season 4 is in no way, shape or form as good as Season 1 and I don't think it's as good as Season 2 either. But based on it's positive reception, I have a feeling that unless Season 5 is a miss (I won't know since I'm officially done with this series), ST will end up being regarded as one of the best shows in recent years. For me, it had a great first season that was a perfect homage to the 80s, but regressed afterwards into a parody of the decade. A one-season wonder, in my opinion."
"Season one blew my mind away, but season two was more of the same and season three was basically disappointing. So, the series started at a 9/10, but then became a 7/10 and finally ended with a 5/10. Somehow the actors lost their spark - maybe the fame got into their heads. Sorry, but season three just didn't do it for me. The Silent Hill effects were completely gone in season three and that somehow interrupted the flow of the series. Still a good effort though. Having said all of this - highly recommend watching the series 'Dark'. It makes you rethink your rating for 'Stranger Things'. 'Dark' is what 'Stranger Things"" should have been 100% of the time.

Added season 4 feedback:

Well, just increased my rating of this show again. Was very high in season one, was okay in season two, a somewhat disappointing season three, but back with a vengeance in season four it seems. The first episode of season four was confusing, but slowly but surely it was picking up the storyline and building up the tension, and would happily score the last two episodes of season four a 9/10. Everything seems to fall in place, the character development, the special effects, the sceneries, the cinematography overall, the music selection, the acting, the 80s feeling, just can't fault it, so well done, a great comeback after a weaker season three. Clearly this is one of the foundation pillars that's keeping Netflix's audience bound to Netflix, just as the Game of Throne instalments are keeping HBO's audience bound to HBO, and Marvel is keeping its audience bound to Disney. Clever and lucky for all three of them. It seems the war of streamers is still full on and likely to continue for a while, guess now it all depends on how loyal and greedy certain directors and producers will prove being."
"The show should have stopped with season 1. Season 3 was a major disappointment-I mean the lame plot with the Russians, cringey dialogue, and boring, repetitive action sequences. Not to mention the uncomfortable kissing sequences between Eleven and Mike. They should just stop beating a dead horse and end the show, but Netflix likes money too much."
I've never wrote a spoiler but here is what sums it up for 2 stars. Every single couple is broken apart at the end! And the one you were rooting for the most........ well the girl ends up being gay! Wow lame lame lame! Seriously there is nothing happy nor satisfying about the end. Not a gosh dang thing! Serious!
"This an utterly meaningless, unintelligent, unimaginative, boring and childish waste of time."
"The dark story is still there and it's enjoyable to watch but unfortunately I had to skip many parts in season 3. The majority of the scenes have this awful teen comedy theme with that typical annoying goofy background music that goes with the ""jokes"". They are all the same and doesn't lead the story anywhere. When you see it coming, just skip 5 minutes of the episode and you won't miss anything important.

I'm very disappointed in the direction this show has taken. 2/3 of this season is something you expect to see on a bad Nickelodeon show."
"I watched it when it first came out - 2016 - and was up to date with the 3rd season. But it's been so long between the 3rd and 4th seasons, that I decided to watch it from the beginning. OMG! Watching the 1st season again had me riveted, again! Totally worth it, too! This show is really SO VERY GOOD! The story, the writing, the acting, the cinematography especially, all first rate! I'm about to start season 4 and I can't wait!"
Best Storyline of all the seasons of Stranger Things. I couldn't stop Watching. Season 4 has this crazy Nightmare on Elm Street vibe and it feels great to be in that environment again in a way that isn't cheesy. All the acting is great but Maya Hawke and Sadie Sink you can't stop watching. Their characters round out this cast so well. No spoilers here but the Vecna story like is pretty great. There were moments in this season that made my anxiety shoot through the roof not knowing what would happen next. The whole Hopper storyline is really well done and the Russian prison theme holds well.
"I loved seasons 1 and 2. I rated the series 10, but this last season lost any sort of adult appeal for me. It was very childish and repetitive. They basically remade season 2 into season 3. The advertising was ridiculous! There isn't any depth to the story. It was all just surface level. I had to force myself to finish each episode and I kept fast-forwarding through the uncomfortable dialogue. The Duffer Brothers need to dig a little deeper or hire people who can do it for them, so they do not ruin this series. Hoping for a better season next time."
"I don't even know where to start but I will focus more on season 4. Season 1 was very good and refreshing, different and unique, season 2 was weaker but still kept me captivated and interested. Season 3 was something different from its predecessors and I understand that they wanted to change something and I understand why some people didn't like it. But season 4 was truly one of the best and most epic seasons I've seen in a series. It felt like a movie, the cinematography, the light, the colors, the special effects that looked better than 90% of the movies at the cinema actually shocked me. The characters and their construction are impeccable, you care about each one and you don't feel that they are boring you. The soundtrack is out of this world even now I have it in my mind and I can't get it out of my head, I'm just looking forward to the last season, I'm very curious how they could do something better than this, I'm waiting to be surprised. Stranger Things is truly the Netflix emblem and I can't think of anything else that could topple it, this time they outdid themselves."
"Season one was amazing, with it being the first season, the mystery was really interesting and the world building was also very interesting. The boys were great characters, they were the focus of the show and they shined, the child performances were really good. Steve Harrington was a terrible character, he was annoying and mean for no reason. The visuals were not good for the first season, the creature didn't look real, the compositing was terrible. The season was great because of the original story and the mystery.

Season two was very similar to the first one, but it lacked the charm of the first because it wasn't new. It improved on two things, the production design was better and the characters were much better. Steve had a bit of a redemption, he became a good guy instead of a annoying jock. Max was a great addition, she's cool and she brings something new to the boys.

Season three gets back the interesting mystery, it is a bit predictable but since it hits close for Max, a amazing character, it feels important. This season is the one that looks the best, it is incomparable to the previous two, the colors were vibrant even in the most mundane locations. Robin is a nice addition to the show, she's fun and brings more to Steve's character.

Season four was the first one where I felt like great characters could die, Max had her life on the line for the whole season and everybody could've died in the upside down. Vecna was a great villain, he was powerful, menacing and mysterious. The visuals weren't as colorful as the previous season but it looked as expensive as it was.

Season 1: 9/10 Season 2: 8/10 Season 3: 8.5/10 Season 4: 9.5/10."
"NO ACTUAL SPOILERS, BUT SOME OUTLINES.

The first season was great: Brave producers that were able to create a show that had such a great 80's vibe, unike story, relatable characters, a pinch of horror and children as main characters that didn't make it a childish show. It was so good that you even could get over the way to obvious product placements in the story. The second season was still good. Even if it could have stopped (story wise) after the first season there still was room to continue as they did. Still a great season but not as good as the first. New introduced characters were still relatable. But after that, the story was over. But then it happend what always happens when people and networks are to greedy: they turned it into a horrible cash grab. The main plot was ridiculously distant from the prior plot. They invented a new story where the ""Russians"" were the bad guys. Wow, I guess that story has never been told before. It was filled with nonsensical and unfunny stereotypes. But the real issue is everything that goes on the side of the plot. The product placement was so laughable that it felt sometimes like a real commercial. The boy&girl relationships were written in a way that they took the most silly stereotypes and made them even more silly. And the worst thing is the character development, especially of the main character ""eleven"". She behaved in a way that was not even remotely realistic given the first two seasons and the backstory. I've cringed so many times over her ""attitude"". And even the rest of the characters became even less relatable.

Conclusion: First two seasons are watchable and the first was really good. But the only good thing about the third season (and probably for the rest of the show) was that I watched it instead of studying for an exam because I was even more bored for studying than watching this piece of garbage. Peace;)"
"I have grown up with this iconic show totally amazing. I have all the merchandise my bedroom is to this day adorned with posters.

Who else has the lights hanging from their wall!

I may need a bigger place as the merchandise is now taking over my lounge.

Either that or I just need a stranger things room dedicated to every cast member m. My favourite cast member is Noah Schnapp.

I also have so many theories on stranger things I should run a whole forum on the show.

I honestly have only watch a few movies since stranger things started and most if this time I only watch stranger things.

I never want it to end well at least another ten seasons please I will be happy with that.

And please do not say the writers can not write no more."
The character development in every season and the story and humour and suspense keeps on increasing and also the fun and excitement in every episode. I hope they make a few more seasons and also a spinoff series would be great.
"Netflix nailed it on with this one. It's story is a definite 10, it's actors always get it right and they genuinely make you feel like part of the show but the score is what bodies it, it is able to immerse any viewer to provide fear, mystery, happiness and just a generally spooky atmosphere. There's no other show like it."
"The 3rd season is in fact so bad, that it ruins the whole show. It's so childish, stupid and unrealistic. And when I say unrealistic I don't mean the monsters and all that crap, but rather how for example four kids can break into a millitary base, that kind of unrealistic. Stranger Things is a kids show masked as a horror show. If you're got an average IQ and you're over the age of 16, I have no idea how you will enjoy this, honestly. It's such a cringefest. I mean it always has been, but not to the extent that is shown in the newest season. Unbelievably stupid, and a waste of your time."
"I am not one to binge TV shows, or even watch them to begin with, although, I LOVE movies. I am very stubborn with which TV shows I invest my time with. With that being said, Stranger Things is one of those few shows that I am so pleased with. I found the idea of the show so unique and imaginative. Im not usually one for Sci-Fi type content, however this was executed in such a way to appeal to my standards. One thing I thought was fascinating was the fact that shows start to decline as the seasons progress. Stranger Things proves anything is possible, as the seasons were just as consistent, if not better from season one to three! I still catch myself watching certain scenes on YouTube, enjoying them as if it's my first time. Im a sucker for some good emotion in any cinematography, I think its the icing on top. The finale of season three really filled that expectation for me, and then some! I really enjoyed this series and I am looking forward for what the cast and crew has in store for us in season 4."
"Mu daughter and I love watching. It's our thing to do together. I love the story line, I admire 11"
"Stranger Things Season 4's (2022) final episodes were released Friday night and my wife and I finished them yesterday. The storyline picks up a year after Season 3 where the now separated group of friends discover life isn't all fun and happiness it was before they were teenagers. Meanwhile, officer Jim Hopper didn't die in the Upside Down; instead, he was transferred through a portal to Russia and is now in a prison camp with its own secrets in the dungeons. Something is alive inside the Upside Down and is beginning to take victims back in the real world of the living. The children will need to face the being, but this time Eleven doesn't have powers. Hopefully this creature in the Upside Down creates a path to save Jim.

This series was created by Matt and Ross Duffer (Wayward Pines) and stars Millie Bobby Brown (Godzilla vs Kong), Winona Ryder (Heathers), Finn Wolfhard (Ghostbusters Afterlife), David Harbour (Black Widow), Gaten Matarazzo (The Blacklist) and Joe Keery (Slice).

My overview of Stranger Things:

Season 1: 10/10 Excellent Show with a strong Stephen King 80s feel to it.

Season 2: 8/10 Still a strong showing. Loved the characters, soundtrack all the elements I enjoyed from season 1 but a step back.

Season 3: 6.5/10 The storyline felt like it was trying too hard, was a bit of a reach and maybe rushed to get a sequel. Series could have easily ended here and been fine.

Season 4 was definitely a reinvestment into the series by Netflix. Everything was bigger - more storylines, more characters, deeper dive into characters backstories and much longer episode run times, which ranged from 1 hour 15 minutes to a final episode that was 2.5 hours (the episode before that was 1 hour 45 minutes). Each episode was like sitting down and watching a movie.

There were too many storylines. The basketball team getting together as vigilantes felt dumb and an excuse for body count. The villain and Eleven backstory was awesome and worthwhile and the dad was also a ruthless character. The Russian prison scenes were tremendous too, other than some of the monologues. The love story was awful and poor Finn's acting skills are terrible. Some characteristics work better when you're a kid than an adult. I was happy with the 80s montage worked in. The special effects and kills by the new villains were tremendous.

Overall, this is an uneven series with some tremendous moments and some moments that suffer from poor editing. The episodes could have definitely been all cut down 15-30 minutes due to containing too much dialogue. I would score Season 4 a 7/10 and strongly recommend it to fans of the series."
"Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far."
"This show has tons of fans for a reason. The perfectly depicted 80s setting, the amazing CGI, the interesting characters, the well done action scenes. It's a recipe for something amazing! Stranger Things explores a mystery of government cover up, supernatural monsters, and alternate dimensions. It is a really fascinating show. Eleven is an outstanding character and the acting from Millie Bobby Brown is stupendous. This show made me feel like a kid again, hunting monsters and escaping danger. It's just so exciting!"
"Season 1&2 were relatively ok, but season 3 was just infused with way too much emotion. Also i fell like Hopper lost all the character development we saw all through the previous seasons and the show is also too focused on relationships ie mike/eleven and max/lucas. I actually didn't finish the season"
"I enjoy the series, but is getting very long with the same main villain and is getting very annoying, the first season is great and the 2 is not that great but it is interesting but the 3 one very necessary, I understand that is very entertaining I get that but they are using a lot the same main point of every season, so watch it and enjoy but don't get surprised if you think that they need to change the pro lam of each season."
"So far we have received 3 out of 5 seasons for stranger things and my god are they incredible, the first season is a horror mystery revolving around a young Will Byers going missing, simple superb, each character has they're defining moment and each played a major part in the series plot, Season 2 was equally as charming and brilliant, add new characters such as Billy, Max and Bob, all 3 of which being incredible additions to the already phenomenal cast. Apart from the less than underwhelming Episode 7, season 2 was just as brilliant as season 1. Season 3 was much darker and grittier but with a lot more comedic elements giving it an exceptional blend between intense action, charming character moments and comedy. Overall Netflix has created one of the best TV shows of this century, Bravo Duffer Brothers!"
"The cast and directors have done an admirable job of making an average monster in the woods story much more enjoyable than one would expect. I also think it somehow appeals to a wide range of ages. I enjoy the 80's nostalgia. The performance of Millie Bobby Brown, particularly in Season 1, is a large part of why this show works. I hope that it doesn't take itself too seriously as it goes forward and that it can hold onto the surprising fun and easy watching it provides. Well worth a watch.

While I think it is good not great, I am always surprised how hard it is to stop watching a season once you start. Maybe it is better in the moment than in the memory."
"As the general consensus goes, season 1 and 2 were really good. If I were to have rated the series on those seasons alone, I'd give a solid 8.5 - 9. However, since the series did not stop at season 2, well that means that season 3 must be considered and boy is it terrible.

Season 3 starts off really slow. Because of that, you don't realize how bad it is until about episode 5 and then it really hits you that, wow, this is bad.

If I could sum it up, I'd say season 3 is sort of like a bad Disney movie with s word being thrown around by kids.

The plot is ridiculous - where are they going with Russians and why? I won't go into details but just know you're expected to believe that 4 kids sneak into an underground facility a la Austin Powers were the guards basically fall for the ol' tap one shoulder and make them look while they sneak past the other way.

Then of course there's the 50' monster just roaming the town and NOBODY besides the cast notices?

It's just dumb. I know you have to suspend disbelief for a show like this but combining the surreal and cheesy lines not to mention the terrible chemistry between Hopper and Joyce this season it's just a train wreck.

At the time of this review, season 4 isn't confirmed and I honestly couldn't care less if the show ended after 3. The first two seasons keep you wanting more. Also, keep in mind that if the past timing is any indication they take about a 3.5 year break in between seasons so I don't know, I guess we'll be seeing Stranger Things - The College Years in season 4. The kids already grew up quite appreciably between seasons 2 and 3."
The series captures the essence of 80s perfectly. Has a new theme- A bit scary and full of thrill. You start loving the Characters as you watch the series. Upto season 4 the season has matched my expectations.
"This is what happens when writers run out of ideas that fit the original tone and premise of the series. The school scenes are completely unrealistic, the multiple plot lines are disconnected, and the directing is over the top. I've been a fan of this series for the first three seasons, but the 4th season is so juvenile that I don't understand what they were thinking when they made it. I watched four episodes and literally couldn't stand to watch any more of it."
"This kind of TV is honestly my favourite and I look forward to the new seasons, it's sad to hear that season 5 will be the last but I know that it's gonna be good. All of the actors in the show are talented and it's been wholesome to watch them grow up as the series has progressed. The team has produced a very good quality show that I will more than likely be rewatching every now and again!"
"Read the header -- they have given us Stranger things and HBO max is living off four series True Detective, Game of Thrones, Westworld, and Mayor of Easttown...but some of those had 2 seasons and netflix has given us countless shows from Bridgerton , squid games,to shows that deserved more like ""the order"" movies like Enola Homes and ect -- and they are held to a standard no one else is Disney is retreading marvel shows at neck break pace and are shot in a week... so again its crazy to see this. Stranger things is an mazing ground breaking show it allows us to connect to a time we may not have been alive for. Millie and Sadie have begun to take over the narrative as future stars and how amazing to see them put this on display."
"Season 1 was great. Original idea, thrill and suspense. By the end of season 1 I was very curious to watch season 2 and to know what kind of danger we have and how it will be defeated, but then it got quickly boring. Although the characters became more sophisticated and we understand their motives, the danger became repetitive. It is same thing we faced before, we know how to fight it, we are confident that we will win. With that feeling as an audience, it was not interesting for me to continue watching because the how and the what for the story was kind of obvious. Skipped to last couple of episodes in season 3, it became even more boring. The danger is exactly the same it just evolved a bit and became bigger. Laughably, neither the police nor the military noticed that a giant creature is destroying the brand new city mall that every one was talking about for so long until punch of kids killed the giant. This is when police shows up. Then we have the Russians who kidnapped an american police officer under the nose of the police from the crime scene. From the look of it, season 4 is going to be about the same thing again... no thanks."
"One of the greatest series I have ever seen.

Each and every episode was so amazing. Especially the first and second season was fire.

Most enjoyed."
"Title says it all, season 3 has no story and it felt like they just made it up as it went along. I will not be watching season 4"
"Just finished the first 7 episodes of Stranger Things season 4 and WOAH!!!!

First season was good, second one lost it's way a little, third season kind of brought it back but WHAM season 4 knocks it right out of the park!!

They way they've tied up all the stories so far is outstanding, some excellent writing. Not to mention the fact that the horror elements in this new one are actually pretty scary for the rating... and the TWISTS!!! I feel like this show is growing with the viewers, which I like; it's definitely darker now it's more established.

Held my hand over my mouth the whole duration of episode 7. Excellent entertainment. Very excited to see how they finish this one off in part 2...I feel some main character deaths coming on *bites nails*!!!"
"It's a great Series and the story line keeps better and better throughout the series. The Duffer Brothers have given a visual treat . Millie Bobby Brown as always has performed wonderfully in this series. Special mention to Jamie Campbell Bower ( VECNA ) who scares the hell out of all the viewers. His performance was outstanding in Season 4. The connection between each series is remarkable, From Season 4 it was looped all the way back to Season 1

Eagerly waiting for Season 5, a bit disappointed that its the last season of the series . Then again heard The Duffer Brothers have more Projects like this in their mind.

Stranger Things = Strangely Awesome."
This is a very solid series with a promising premise. It really gets the style down well with a lot of 80s homages. The first season is the best as it has an intense build up and reveals its secrets slowly. The other seasons got a bit silly and repetitive. The characters and science fiction elements are both done very well.
"I ended up binge-watching the entire season - 4 episodes yesterday and 4 tonight - like so many others!! I thought it was excellent! I'm not even a huge ""80's"" era fan, but this show managed to find the very best of that decade and bring it to positive light. The homage to the films and writers was so well done and the music was amazing! Parts of the show reminded me of ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" as well. After I watched the entire season, I realized I was thoroughly entertained and without a single scene of gratuitous violence or sex, something that much of today's programming relies on vs. back in the 80's or earlier. I found it refreshing and yes it's something a family can actually watch together (although very young children might be frightened by the monster). The only reason I did not rate this show a 10 is I thought Ryder's character was a bit too much at times. The constant hysterics wore me out for the first half of the season but it did get better in the second half. I understand she was a panicked mother so I can't put a finger on it. I just found Joyce a little annoying. I'm not sure if that was an acting or writing flaw so I will leave it at that. That was minor though and I still would recommend this show wholeheartedly!! I hope they bring it back for more season(s)!"
"Writing this review in the month of December 2020, I will try to give my perspective according to each individual season. Three so far!

Season 1 :

The show commences on a pretty high note. Glimmering visuals, techno inspired Soundscore and 80's nostalgia. Pretty spot on right from the start. Now comes a bunch of charismatic & relatable characters. We also got some stunning array of performances; especially mentioning the child actors! And Millie Bobby Brown, outperforming everyone else. The casting team deserves a whole lot of praise for bringing such a talented individual into the scene. Helped by an intriguing narration; this was indeed a great experience. My only nitpicks here would be about the antagonist. The writing on his character just didn't come out as expected. Season Rating - 8.5/10

Season 2 :

With this afresh addition, we got introduced to several new faces. Some of them became instantly likable such as Bob, Max. The most striking difference I could possibly find is the balance between distinctive traits in all those characters. They are absolutely not one-dimensional. The writing here has vastly improved from its previous iteration. It had become more mature and motivated! Humour, Thrill, Romance, Horror. An ambitious blend, which is undoubtedly delicious and well served. The core storyline takes a little bit of time to build up, but the wait is worthwhile. Performance wise everyone left an impression. In the first, Millie Bobby Brown was the standout, now she has a competition and that's coming from Noah Schnapp aka Will. A terrific act. Especially in the 5th & 6th episodes, where he had outdone himself. My only gripe would be the 7th episode. Where, El takes a detour to find her estranged 'Sister' who also happens to be a 'Special' kid. Now, many of you might not agree with me here, but this episode seemed like a big letdown. As it didn't really contribute much in terms of the overall narrative! Season Rating - 9/10

Season 3 : The first two episodes were a bit stretch, not quite contributing enough to the main plot. From 3rd; things start moving. Few new set of characters are introduced, among them Robbin would be worth mentioning. Although the characterization is good enough, I feel the focus wasn't really on the characters and their individual perspectives this time. Unlike the second season, it's not as emotionally investing. All the main characters are just investigating on their own, playing their essential parts in these strange occurences happening around the town of Hawkins. The momentum continues till the 7th episode! Where it once again starts to drag a little bit. But the climax somewhat redeemed/overshadowed any shortcomings beforehand. If I could describe it in a sentence, 'Season 3 is your typical Hollywood blockbuster flick, with Action, Adventure, Romance, Drama, Thrill; altogether'. Personally speaking, the second season is still my favourite from the bunch, this was close but again; I'm not so sure about the idea of including Political philosophies in a Teenage Adventure Drama. Season Rating - 8.5/10"
"Oh dear, oh dear, where to begin. As the summary suggests we loved the first season, yes, it had its flaws, mainly in the terrible script but we (the people I watched it with) forgave that in light of a gripping, well paced narrative.

My biggest gripe about ST2 is the poor mechanics. By this I mean the story doesn't work. The continuation of how principle characters from ST1 behave in ST2 doesn't add up. When you acknowledge that that target audience for this is the 30-40 age bracket, meta-geeks and nostalgia-nuts who remember the films, music, games, culture of the 1980's, you must pay tribute to the intelligence that this group of people bring. OK, I'll say it, we're geeks and geeks like things to make sense.

Dusting would not treat a baby demagorgon as a pet, nor would he hide it. Hopper behaves practically like a jealous lover, a Jozef Fritzl to Eleven. Eleven barely spoke in ST1. So many incongruities. The top secret HAL lab, that anyone can just roll up to and gain access. What annoys me the most is that the Duffer Brothers have created a story of total rubbish, they have trampled over the credibility of the characters they successfully developed in ST1. They have done with ST2 what Disney have done to Star Wars: repackaged the original with louder bangs and hoped that the audience doesn't call them out on a flagrant cashing in on a premise with no substance.

Ultimately, I know I shouldn't care, but I do because I love ST1 and I hate ST2 for it's lazy storyline, it's awful script and really shoddy CGI."
This show is truely amazing....all seasons 1-3 were perfect and I can't wait for season 4 to drop in 2022??
"The first series started so well. Eerie, edge of your seat story, intense and very relatable nostalgia. The second season continued this intriguing story about El with great new characters, all ending in a huge finale - to which point, I'd have rated it a solid 8/10. Now this third series has none of the good points it made in the previous two. News flash, the audience doesn't care about the awkward teenaged relationships (or anyone else's relationships). It's a huge waste of time that adds nothing to the story apart from delaying it. They really should have kept with the story of El and the other 'Uber Soldiers'. They've separated the cast to expand the story but all it's done is dismantle what made it solid in the first place. Now it's just a cheesey boring storyline with some pretty horrific acting. So poor. What a shame. It's a 2 from me."
"Season 1 was fantastic, season 2 kept the ball rolling. Season 3 was a poor concept riddled with weak characters who's behavior was inconsistent from previous seasons, drawn out far too long and wrapped up so poorly that the characters on the show could have written a better script. Haven't been so let down by a show's ending since how I met your mother."
"Who doesn't like strange things combined with the 80's? People need to stop complaining as this show is great! It's got tongue and cheek, big scary monsters/monster, great cast, story line, killer music and keeps me coming back for more!!! Cannot wait for the next season."
Season 1 and 2 were amazing. The story really should've just ended there. The quality fell off of a cliff since then and feels like a money grab instead of an inspired story. Season 3 had a jarring tone shift where everything felt like a bad cartoon. Tried too hard to be funny but just wasn't. Season 4 feels like a cheesy soap opera. A problem with these types of shows is how every season needs to add new characters and add new monsters which get bigger and bigger to the point of silliness. By the fourth season there's way too many characters so the story has to constantly jump around every 2-3 minutes and the villain feels like a Marvel character.
"Really, after the excellent 1st & 2nd seasons, this one is pain. I had to watch the 2 last episodes with fast forwarding just to end this pain faster. Behavior of the characters is ridiculous, the writes put a lot of unsuitable comedy into the show with stupid 'comedy' music. The suspense has been lost (only a couple of moments, El's journeys were good). I dont plan to watch the 4th season."
"I, like most people, enjoy shows the most when they have a combination of certain elements; quality acting, a topic of interest to me, a fitting soundtrack, proper character development, etc. Above all of those qualities though, sits the most important aspect of a television series or movie - the ability to draw emotional involvement from the viewer. A select few have had the capacity to foster the bittersweet happiness that comes from finishing something you've been so invested in. It's an odd thing when something can evoke sadness - and yet a sadness you don't wish to push away, but to wallow in, if at least for a little while. Stranger Things has met that mark.

A particularly interesting part of this series is the journey of maturation the child actors are partaking in. It goes without saying that Millie Bobby Brown is a shooting star in the acting world and is far from her zenith. The rest of the party performs laudably, and seeing them get their big break is a fun thing to behold.

David Harbour complements Millie's performance with a terrific effort as Chief Jim Hopper. Both excel in portraying the qualities which define what it is to be human; the idiosyncrasies, the varied nature of our individual capabilities, and the ways in which we cope with these strengths and weaknesses.

The plot of the show, while not bad, fails to live up to the far-reaching standards of the other aspects. Especially in Season Three, it seems a struggle to find ways to continue the plot; sometimes resulting in contrived and lackluster turns. Despite these shortcomings, this show remains a phenomenon which I'm happy to have experienced."
"At first I saw a lot of Spielburg in Stranger Things, then once I got a few episodes in I realized that it's actually inspired mostly by Stephen King stories. Stranger Things = Stephen King (get it?). The biggest contributors I've noticed are Stand By Me, Dead Zone, Creepshow and Firestarter.

It's very well done, the visuals are great, the acting is good and the pace is brisk enough that it should keep most people interested. It does help if you're familiar with 80's thrillers because nostalgia is one of Stranger Thing's strengths.

It's definitely weird, which is expected. I definitely see this show becoming a quick cult favorite."
"At the beginning of season 4 I thought it was a big drawn out and boring but it turned then into the second best season of stranger things in my opinion. It was incredible, really smart writing (re Vecna) and great music (as always). It doesn't quite reach the level of season 1 only because El doesn't feature as much and because of Hopper's storyline that didn't really need to be there. Felt sorry for Eddie and didn't think they gave him justice in the final battle but great character. Loved also Johnathan's friend with the pizza van. Max was outstanding. Overall, they did another great job with this season."
"This show should've ended with 2 seasons. I'm trying to watch S4 E1, and I don't remember a thing about any major plot. All I remember is that I was losing my interest in S3. The show is not good enough for me to go back and watch it again. After the 2+ year intermission, the kids have grown up too much. They are now creepy and awkward. I cannot think of them as the same characters and therefore it fails in making me like them. It's a problem of any show with children stretching over too many years. So far, it seems to try too hard to blind the viewers with the 80's fashion and music."
"Described as an homage to the 80s, Stranger Things feel more like a second rate mix of Spielberg's anything produced in that decade, the Twilight Zone, a touch of Stephen King, Alien and countless horror movies.

The series targets teenagers, who apparently fell for it big way. Also nostalgic fellows with a soft spot for synthesizers, the main source of the ""period"" soundtrack.

The plot is set in motion by four boys cycling at night through a dark wood -> cliché.

Will, one of the boys goes missing after meeting an unseen but horrible creature -> cliché.

The police starts combing the dark forest holding shaky flashlights -> cliché.

More searching will be done, ALL in dark places and ALL with shaky flashlights.

This series of clichés is compounded by a truckload of others, crushing any possible foray into uncharted territory. For instance, Will's mother is hysterical and behaves crazily, but everybody knows she is right and misjudged by society.

To hit even better the teenage target, the key character is El (for 011, the number tattooed on her arm), a pre-pubescent girl, who cannot talk normally and communicates via rolling her big eyes and muttering a few words. Obviously there would not be much ""suspense"" if El would just give a detailed account of her experience, but the contrivance of her silence is annoying.

Yet more teenage angst is added with a sub-plot involving the sister of one of the boys, her sexual escapades and the abduction of her best friend. A little bit more of the scary monster is shown in each episode, in proper horror movie fashion, waiting for denouement in the last episode - where we will be shown how evil is the government and how brave is anybody under twenty, plus Will's mother.

A paint by number futile exercise in nostalgia that does not even work on the horror- supernatural angle, due to over-predictability. High rating demonstrate how successful is show-business at scraping the bottom of the barrel and recycling overused storytelling formats for the ""benefit"" of younger audience."
"I love it when you have no idea what a show is about and it just grabs you in the first season. Thank god it was in Netflix, I couldn't have waited week to week. I really think Mille Bobby Brown deserved to when the Emmy's she was nominated for. She conveys such a vast array of emotions and feelings while having very few words to speak. She truly is captivating.

The 3 seasons follow the same main plot line however this doesn't get tedious or boring. Character development is done in such interesting ways. Can't wait for season 4 in 2022.

Do yourself a favour and binge it."
"Simply the best and most addictive series out there. Amazing characters and character development, each season has a fantastic story whilst still building on previous series.

I personally love the 1980's theming.

Great actors, great writers, great directors. Can't wait for the finale of season 4, I expect if it's anything like the first 7 episodes, it will be something epic."
"Stranger Things are what television and movies used to be about. Imagination, fun, mystery, suspense, a dash of comedy. Before youth was force fed Marvel Comic adaptation after adaptation after reboot after remake after sequel, there was seriously good, quality material to sink your chops into.

Thank goodness for Netflix because without them, ""Stranger Things"" would never have gotten made. I'm so glad it did. This was a tour de Force of filmmaking, with stellar performances by Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully eccentric cast of beloved misfits you embrace from the first episode. You will hear a lot of people compare it to classic 80's films The Goonies, but it's less like those films and more like what would have been created by the Masterful 80's filmmakers that created the flicks that became iconic.

This series demonstrates with unapologetic glory what entertainment could be if we allowed more original content into our sphere, rather than the regurgitations and comic saturation that obliterated the blockbuster and dumbed it down to the IQ of a gnat. This is why we remember the 80's films so fondly. They were better.

Star Wars was a film that changed the industry, much thanks to the young pioneer George Lucas. Following him through that gate of genius was Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemekis, Ron Howard and so many artists with stories to tell. The Duffer Brothers are a hugely welcome, long overdue addition to that club, and so is their series, ""Stranger things.""

Packed with nods to yesteryear cinema, it never has to rely on sex, drugs and exploding cars to pull you in, but instead grips you with a brilliant storyline and powerful performances. It lets you have fun again, without beating you over the head with the common ""Look how much money we spent"" plague.

I hope for a second series. There is no question, this is full of tomorrows biggest stars, especially Millie Bobby Brown whose turn here is mind blowing. Emmy should hand them their awards now."
"Stranger Things season 2 surpassed the first season. I have to write something after reading several reviewers who said that the story is predictable and clichéd. What they don't understand is that is not important. The creators of Stranger Things know how to tell a good story, they recognise that it comes from strong characters and that what gives a story richness is the strength of the characters in the first place and from there, their interaction, the story and plot is driven by the characters acting true to themselves. In a great story the plot may be predictable but that is for the very reason that as you come to know who the characters are you can see how they will act. Situations then become of great interest as you feel almost as if you are a part of the story, because in your mind you feel the characters are real and you place yourself alongside with them and 'live' the story with them. To call this cliché betrays a lack of empathy with the characters. This can come about if the characters are undeveloped and remote. But in a story such as Stranger Things the characters are consistently strong and believable and earn your empathy. This gives you faith to invest more of your attention to the drama, draws you into the story. It is clichéd because every great story has always done this. This is the essence of great story telling. What is important is whether or not a movie, book, TV series, piece of music has soul. If it comes from the right place then it can take you on a journey, a real journey of discovery into yourself just as the creator went on a journey into themselves to create it. Too much modern art and culture is calculated, from the intellect, it is empty. No matter how good the execution is it is still empty in the end and cannot leave a lasting impression. Stranger Things is destined to become a modern classic of the TV series genre. Needless to say it is also very well executed in all departments too, from the acting to the music, the cinematography, the direction. It has no pretensions, it is what it is and it is very very good! I want more entertainment like this and less like the last film i reviewed which was Blade Runner 2049 which i think is symptomatic of what is wrong with Hollywood. Over calculated and pretentious instead of just real and heartfelt. Stranger Things gets my highest rating a 9/10."
"I did not expect to be so entertaining. Fantastic script, scenery and acting!"
"Any science fiction/fantasy series worth watching knows that seasons must build the story until their final season. Stranger Things 3 chose to adopt the generic ""evil Russian"" plot to reopen and rehash the material we came to understand in Season 2. Their motives are never explained. It's lazy writing. In addition, a completely unnecessary death of a main character feels like a Hail Mary attempt to force emotions from viewers."
"Let's keep it real shall we? There's no way on earth the Duffer brothers were prepared to continue past ONE season. There was NO set up, whatsoever.

Since Season One we've been blindly clawing away for an intelligent story to sink into, but instead have gotten stolen characters and narratives from hit 80s films and pop culture.

Where's the actual substance? You can only impress for so long with cheap, greasy special effects and Kate Bush riffs. The story is nonsensical, even by sci-fi standards.

The elementary dialogue was never-ending; exposition galore. Bloated episodes, a multitude of strange departures of cinematography and tone from what was set in Season One, and less believable acting then seen in previous seasons.

Anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece has a very limited understanding of filmmaking and writing.

I know how terribly difficult it is to accomplish shooting anything, let alone 10 over and hour long episodes. But for almost $300M- it's baffling!!"
"No idea why they ruined the series so bad. Please save your time and don't watch season 3. It's tv series at it's worst, trust me!

Season 1 worth a 10/10 but IMO rating comes according to your worst season. And season 3 worth like 0/10, even 1/10 is high"
"No matter the structure and details are not rigorous enough, but the good thing is that the atmosphere is well constructed and the visual impression is good. The performances of several children are also quite vivid and nostalgic."
"Stranger things

As a forty one year old guy who grew up in the 80's this show transported me back to my childhood. A superbly crafted piece of television, Stranger things is well written with an authentic 80's feel. Without spoiling the plot the show starts off as a missing kid drama with a supernatural twist. Imagination soon runs wild as this show takes unexpected turn after unexpected turn. A sort of crossover between the Goonies, ET, the X files and a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things is truly gripping right from the opening credits with the bold red font and synthesizer theme tune. It plays like something from an old video game or 80's horror movie. There's even the white flecks that speckle across the screen just as they would on an old VHS copy. Such subtleties and attention to detail prove that the creators of this fantastic show really do care and have a true affection for 80's pop culture and the nostalgia that goes with it.

The acting is fantastic, especially from the young cast. At last a group of child actors who speak and behave like real kids. There's a wonderful sense of humour here which can only be delivered with adolescence. David Harbour and Winona Ryder back up the kids as strong support but there's no denying it's the youth that steal this show. Special effects look great and production value is strong considering that this is a fairly small scale TV show. Netflix continue to knock the ball out of the park and bigger studios should stand up and take note. I for one was bowled over by Stranger things right from the very first episode. I'm really looking forward to what the Duffer brothers do with season two and where their imagination will take us all next."
"Bad comedy made for kids, painful writing and of course, the must-have ""girl power"" that infestate most shows and movies nowadays.

But they did it, like in many other productions, in the most stupid and sexist way possible: they depict most men in the show as dumb or clueless while all mysteries, actions and problems can only be solved by the women.

Pro-tip: if you think that the only way to show how strong women are is by depicting men as bad, then you don't have a good argument to begin with."
"I was transfixed by Seasons 1 & 2 - they were brilliantly done.

Season 3 made me drop a 9/10 rating to 6/10.

I lasted 1.45 episodes of S3 and had to turn it off. Stilted, predictable, obvious, too much kitsch. All that was missing was the canned laughter, comedy sound effects and the sad trombone when someone made an oopsie.

Disappointing."
"Season 1 - 7/10 Season 2 - 6/10 Season 3 - 2/10

Season 3 is a totally disaster, is it a comedy? They trying so hard to make us laugh, but failed badly

Nuff said"
"This series is a brilliant watch, it's gripping and very well directed. The cinematography is nothing short of brilliant, down to the lighting and the overlays on the screen this was fantastic to view. I really enjoyed the story also, it's a modern classic for sure, something everyone should watch as the next generation will ask if you have seen it.

The themes are very good and the story is very well written, the dialog and acting are fantastic also, to take children and have them so compelling is always something I've been amazed and confused by but this cast certainly does that. There acting is brilliant and as before mentioned it's helped allot by the dialog, the writers did a great job.

Please watch, you will either be satisfied, gratified or surprisingly happy. Everything is very well done."
"I can honestly say that I have never seen a show quite like Stranger Things. Created by the Duffer Brothers, it is a show that was meant to be as 1980s as possible in both its theme and storyline.

It tells the story of a group of kids (and eventually some of the adults as well) stumbling upon a secret government contract after the disappearance of one of the kids. The project involves them giving kids powers and also them tapping into other dimensions. Without getting too spoiler heavy, the plot of the show is the battle between them and the other dimension that is coming into the their town.

The story is a fine mix of 80s science fiction, horror, comedy and it throws in a little bit of an X-Men theme as well. The show is simply tremendous and is made even better with a cast that has the best chemistry. Seriously, this extremely large cast of characters is wonderful to watch and make each moment feel like something special.

With that said, the show might be a turn off for some because some might not like the genre in general, and it is a bit confusing at times, especially as time has gone on and they've had to stretch out the story.

That's really the only flaw with the show is that you could tell the writers were stretching at times and sometimes they would hit a brick wall with some of the storytelling. I've only seen part of season four and it's always a hope that shows like these are able to wrap up loose ends instead of leaving gaping plot holes.

So overall, it truly is one of kind. While it has hit an occasional skid in its latter stages, it's still a standout show and easily the best on Netflix."
"While the third season did not quiet have the charm of the first 2, my wife and I are still very much enjoying this series. Looking forward to see where season 4 will take us."
"You HAVE TO watch it.

It's a very well orchestrated season and the last episode is the one you have to watch. It's heartbreaking that things are not all happy ending but that is the reason that I think it is epic.

Hands down to Eddie. Most Metal Ever!!!"
"Season 1 was a masterpiece. There shouldn't have been a 2nd one in the first place but, okay, season 2 was alright. Season 3, now... ughh there was no reason for this one to exist whatsoever. No character development, no answers to any of our questions from the previous seasons, nothing. Hopper became unreasonable out of nowhere, all of his development as a character was taken away for... reasons, I guess? Season 3 also felt more like a Scooby Doo episode, but with ridiculous propaganda everywhere and unnecessary dialogue as well. Making Hopper take a huge step back as a character, then killing him and then throwing the hint that yeah, um, maaaybe he didn't die after all was cheap at best. I mean, really!? This tired trope? I'd swear the writers were different ones this time, but... nope. If you can't make a decent season, then don't make one at all. I'd rather the series had ended at a point when it was still watchable. Also: Max shouldn't have so much screen time, and shouldn't be sold as a ""wise"" advisor to El. We didn't really need the teen drama, it wasn't even believable or decently written. Huge disappointment, season 3 dragged the whole series in the mud. Oh and a girl couldn't possibly not like Steve, she'd have to be gay for that to happen. Clumsily trying to be inclusive, I get it, but... meh. Didn't get that right either. Finally, to be fair, Billy's death scene (apart from being emotionally abusive to the audience, cheap trick) was spectacular. I couldn't look away even though I wanted to. In general... a tired ""meh"". Stop making the show worse with every season."
"This show is practically perfect in every way. It's very true to the aesthetic, culture, look and feel of the 80's, the actors are excellent and perfectly cast, and it's sort of a juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated attributes. It manages to be a fantastic homage to the pop culture of the era while at the the same time being altogether refreshing and new. One of the best series ever."
"When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief and his friends must confront terrifying supernatural forces in order to get him back.

Think about it like this it's a mix between E.T and the x_files in a really good way, the kids are just so talented ,its hard to talk more about the story but you will enjoy,the series is a winner of Golden Globes 2017 & 2018 for best drama series, i Would just say season 1&2 incredible season 3 a lot of why ?! ."
"I'm sorry fans, and bingers. S2 nor 3 really did it for me. 3 just had way to too much nonsensical unnecessary banter scenes between all the of the cast. And it really took away from the whole sci-fi experience of what the made a show a hit in S1. It was just was long and drawn out and and I was more excited about getting to the end of this season then watching it. Way too much conversation about nothing and it killed it for me. If there is a S4 (after the credits you get a glimpse that it might be one) I will not be indulging. I'm done with the series."
"The first season is good. The second season is alright, but nowhere near the quality of the first. The third season is all over the place, not good at all.

This is yet another example of a series that had a strong start with an intriguing story that just becomes overwatered and pointless once the directors figured out they could make big bucks off of it.

Not to mention the very punchable faces of most of the main characters. Steve is probably one of the few redeeming characters of the show as it goes on.

First season is a go, but don't waste your time on the cheap money grab that is the remainder."
"Everything about this series is excellent.

Cast, screen writing, the period piece, soundtrack, acting; its all amazing.

David Harbour is beyond amazing. He should get nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as the Chief.

Winona Ryder is excellent. Loved they are acting again together. Previous was in The Iceman (2012) which if you haven't seen is excellent.

This series by the Duffer Brothers developed the characters beyond anything I can recall seeing recently. Every character is likable or not and its because you know something about them. Right down to the boys science teacher.

Matthew Modine is extremely good as the federal agent. I can't recall a role he's done that I didn't like.

Please have an open mind with this series and watch it. Rewatch any unfinished episodes. Netflix Original nailed it yet again.

Excellent."
"The Season 1 was interesting... with very good feelings of 80's. The story was good, the characters were authentic, It was funny theyblundered everythings... The season 1 was good. 8/10

The season 2 was a lacklustre replica.... not more 5/10

The Season 3 was a bad season... Banal, corny, foolish, laughable, boring, impeached, 2/10"
Complete n utter demolition of all they built on season 1-2. ..
"A great tribute to eighty.

There were moment were i laugh and others were i cried.

It was funny but also sad and the concept of the family and dromedario was always at the center of the serie.

Only one question: Where the heck were all the parents? I cannot believe that all those kids could go where they wanted and noone seemed worry.

Even soldiers were incapable to stop them."
"The Shire is burning!.Shall we follow Eddie into Mordor? Oh my! This show is very scary and Vecna is even more bizarre and supernatural that previous seasons. The Jewish character Murray (my namesake) is really funny and a great actor as he portrayed black belt karate expert that never won a fight, or even engaged in one... Without giving anything away, this is a must watch for fall entertainment in 2022! You've really got to see this! The Shire is burning!.Shall we follow Eddie into Mordor? Oh my! This show is very scary and Vecna is even more bizarre and supernatural that previous seasons. The Jewish character Murray (my namesake) is really funny and a great actor as he portrayed black belt karate expert that never won a fight, or even engaged in one... Without giving anything away, this is a must watch for fall entertainment in 2022! Murf."
"Season 1 = 9/10, season 2 = 7/10, season 3 = 2/10. Season 3 what a joke. No plot, no story, nothing new, cheesy, cliche, just plain annoying dialogues, illogical, cringey. CRINGEY! What a woeful, horrid season. Writers and producers should be ashamed."
"I am pretty sure that this series have been growing as a overrated one in recent years but still with that we cannot deny that it is quite good, personally it is very stylish and wins over the audience without hesitation.

The wait was worth it."
"I really enjoyed this season of the show! Everything that was happening in Hawkins was brilliant and some of the best material this show has produced. The Vecna/Henry/001 storyline was wonderfully well written and the makeup on Vecna looks like something out of a Del Toro Movie. How they we're able to tie together Eleven and the lab into Vecna and the Upside Down gave the show a grander scope than I thought possible and I'm here for it. All the characters in Hawkins; Steve, Dustin, Nancy, Lucas, Max, Robin, Eddie and Erica are all written and played to perfection. I never wanted the show to cut away from them! I was insanely nervous watching them all attack Vecna in multiple dimensions and justifiably so. Seeing Eddie and Max die was heartbreaking. Although, Seeing Eddie play Master of Puppets in the Upside Down is one of the most Metal Things I've ever seen! I'm torn on Max's coma situation, but I'll wait to judge it until next season.

Millie Bobby Brown was wonderful this season! I loved that Eleven finally stood up to Papa and was in charge of her own destiny. Her confrontations with Vecna put my on the edge of my seat. They've set up the perfect Hero/Villain dynamic and set the stage for Season 5 in big way by letting our heroes lose. Seeing the gate rip open across the town was pure cinema! I never thought we'd get to see something like this on TV 20 years ago, proving that television is the superior medium at this moment in time.

Having said all that, there was some things I didn't love. The Russia Prison storyline bored me to death. Everything happening in Hawkins, made the other storylines pale in comparison. I love Hopper, Joyce and Murray, but I feel like this season sidelined them because they didn't know what else to do with them. Same with the California crew. Mike, Jonathan and Will were all wasted this season. They spent the entire time running to catch up with everyone else. Mike learned how to say 'I love you' to Eleven and that was about it in terms of growth for any of them. I love these characters and it sucks to see them not participating in the grander story. This really bothered me with Joyce! Joyce is the ultimate Momma-Bear, and it was strange seeing her away from her kids all season long.

Overall, I really did enjoy the season! I think the pros outweighed any of my complaints. The writing, the direction, the actors, the production value, the music (oh my God the music was AMAZING), all come together to make what is in my opinion the best show currently airing. I truly believe this is the 'Harry Potter' of the streaming generation. It's a wonderful and dangerous world filled with fascinating characters both young and old and we're watching these kids grow into adults as the story progresses all while capturing the attention of the entire world. It truly feels like we are experiencing something special and I'm beyond excited to see how this story concludes when Season 5 arrives!"
"This show will be remembered long after it's time. It has comedy, romance, action...just everything! The show definitely has a way of making you want to binge watch the entire series in one sitting. After a while, you begin to fall in love with the characters you hated at first. I absolutely recommend this show to all the Sci-Fi lovers out there looking for something different."
My favorite show of all time it is treat to watch series like this who attach us emotionally with each and every character . Duffer brothers has done excellent job
"That's right, I actually cried watching Stranger Things, especially during the last two episodes of season 2. I never thought an adventure/sci-fi type show would get me so emotionally attached, but Stranger Things made it happen. I had goosebumps, tears and at times I even punched the air from excitement.

Part of the strong emotional response is due to the rich characters - their personal background and emotional life play a huge role in the drama. I empathised deeply with Joyce's warrior spirit, Hopper's loss, the Stand By Me-like friendship between Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Will, and the blossoming relationship between Jonathan and Nancy. And while Will is my favourite character, I feel the most special towards Eleven, as she essentially has no real home.

All of this makes the storyline believable and relatable to me, even when the fantasy element seems larger than life. Yes: seems, because once I started looking closer, I realised a lot of the fantasy part is firmly rooted in reality. One take on Stranger Things could be that - apart from being a bad-ass adventure with some world class music - it's a show that deals with trauma, in a stylised, metaphoric way. Will's disapperance into the Upside Down is a traumatic experience, which makes him more vulnerable to a similar experience later on. Most of the main characters deal with a personal trauma in some kind of way. Hopper losing his daughter; Joyce being faced with her husband running off, and then losing her new partner; and ofcourse Eleven having her entire childhood stolen from her. Mike too deals with trauma when he misses El so much after het initial disappearance in the season 1 finale. The way he keeps looking over to El's place in his room and calls her every night struck a chord of real grief.

The thing I appreciate most about the way the traumas are portrayed is the fact that life is never the same again for any of the characters. We see this most clearly with Will, who, when returned from the Upside Down, goes through life known as 'zombie boy', having lost the innocence of his former childhood years. And when he becomes infected and seems to be lost to his loved ones, it made me think of depression or other mental conditions where the patient no longer seems to be themselves to their surroundings. When Joyce, Jonathan and Mike relate their personal memories of Will to him, in order to reach his true self again, it set the tear ducts running for sure.

This is all part of what trauma can do to people - while at the same time Stranger Things shows that people cope and adapt in some form or another (a fact even stated explicitly in season 2).

What's more, Dr. Brenner compares Eleven's childhood trauma to a wound that spreads, like the vines of the superorganism. It would go too far to see the Upside Down, the Demo-dogs, the virus etc. All as mere allegory for real-life experiences and concepts, but it seems to me they do come from a profound insight into human existence. Also, watching season 2 in covid times made the virus theme extra poignant.

Looking forward to diving into season 3 soon, with anticipation for season 4 already as high as the Shadowmonster looming over Hawkins..."
"!!!SMALL SPOILER FROM END OF EPISODE ONE!!!

This is my absolute favorite show. I give it a 10/10! I watched this show with my sister and I loved it so much! The way they just made the show makes you feel like you are a part of it. Like when will goes missing you wonder ""what is that!?"" or ""no willllll!"" you just feel like you are a part of the show! But a warning be careful because you will most likely get addicted! There are a bit of jump scares but there's also so many beautiful moments. The episodes are a bit long but it all pays off! Anyways, I totally recommend!"
"After a great first season, a second .. not so good one already, this was the disappointment of the year. Teenage love stories, childish dialogues, poor acting and all possible boring and simply impossible situations. Even or maybe especially Russians cannot be that blind, stupid and fitted with these make-believe clichés. The sherif has mentally fallen back to ""Kindergarten"" level. Too much teenager ""bla blas"". Stopped watching after painful 1,5 episodes."
"I am so very sad to write this review, I struggled and struggled to love season 3 but I was sorrrrrely disappointed. Many of the scenes dragged on and on and MANY storylines were not explained, such as the main one!! Why the F did the Russians even want to open the gate in the freakin first place?? And WHYYY WAS my beloved Hopper killed off?!?! WTF. He was pretty much my main reason for limping along with it. Just too much ridiculousness and sloppy story telling. It seemed they sacrificed any semblance of a coherent story for the campiness of over the top 80s nostalgia and not to mention beat- you-over- the -head product placement. Too much winking at the viewer with cutesy references. I'm done. Shark done jumped."
"I've put off watching this for 4 years because I thought it was for kids/teens. Then 2 years ago I wondered what all the fuss was about, so I tried watching the first episode but just couldn't get into it (maybe I wasn't in the right mood).

I'm so glad I tried again!

Season 1: 8/10.

Season 2: 7/10.

Season 3: 8/10.

Season 4 10/10.

Bravo. Just...... Bravo!"
"There's just one thing that really impressed me about this series and that is the high IMDb rating given to this heap of garbage.

I say this because I find it utterly amazing that the reviewers who rated this steaming pile of excrement with 9's and 10's must surely ALL be under 12 years of age, and yet they have somehow managed to write reviews that, for the most part, are well worded, grammatically correct and with very few spelling errors. So - well done, kids!!

For anyone over 12 years of age - please, just stay right away from this stinker.

(PS: Would it have hurt to have given poor ""11"" a Kleenex tissue or two?)"
"NOTHING original and vastly overrated, just a collection of scenes and ideas from other movies with nothing to add to the genres, if it was rated accurately it would have a five out of ten"
"This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, this is also one of those rare kinds of shows where it's one that I feel was just made for me as it just about has everything I want.

I love the show is a period piece, the show has a bit of a two way effect, for people like myself that have lived in the 80's decade, it's a really big welcome piece of nostalgia as the film just has everything 80's to a tee.

Just seeing this show really makes me feel like a kid again, living and being part of that decade once more. There is a really big sense of familiarity from the movies, certain technology they have like VHS's, Dungeon's and Dragons, but my absolute favorite thing is the Starcade video arcade with all of the classic video games I know and love like ""Dragon's Lair"", ""Dig Dug"", etc. Just seeing the characters playing in that video arcade makes me sorely miss them but also motivated me to play some of those classics again.

You name any of the culture and relics of the 80's it's all there. For anyone that never lived in that decade, this show can be an educational history lesson for anyone interested in that decade.

Setting the show in the 80's really works, from giving you the feel of seeing a movie from that decade as most of their film were really colorful and most involved ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances. But also fit with the drama as the 80's decade was a time of a certain degree of chaos under all the brightness of the 80's but also great change and the rise of culture and counterculture.

I really love the title sequence, from the big red-letter graphic design that look like the kind you would see from the horror novels from yesteryear. But also that theme music which is great it's one of my favorite theme songs of all time, it sound like the kind of music from a John Carpenter film which is cool as he's my favorite movie director and makes sense as his films were a big part of the 80's decade.

The effects are great there is some CGI but mixed with some practical effects. Really love seeing those creatures from the upside down, they don't disappoint as the kind from H.P. Lovecraft tales, whom are all strange and messed up. Their the kind of creatures you must see to believe along with the upside-down world which is equally all kinds of messed up. But also, like how the psychic powers are handled, they really look and feel believable. The suspense is also great and can be a scary sometimes.

Really love the story, it almost feels a bit like this could of easily of been a Pre Sequel story to ""The X-Files"" which is ironic I say as ""The X-Files"" had a couple of pre sequel comic stories from IDW on Mulder and Skully. Man, this could have made an awesome crossover seeing Mulder and Skully encounter adult versions of Eleven and Mike, along with the rest.

Anyway, the storyline is great not just does it feel a little like ""The X-Files"" with the shadow organizations, conspiracies, psychic powers, monster, etc. But also, the show draws inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft, as it deals with otherworldly realms and the creatures that exist in them. I like the pacing, which is a steady pace when it gets further it starts to pick up more and more speed. The show is the serialized structure but it's not too long, there are twists along the way but their good twists because there is actual weight to them because they make sense and also keep the story's eye on the ball.

And of course, the true strength of the show for me are the Strange Raiders characters themselves. These guys are my favorite fictional protagonists of all time, I love how all of them are well rounded and develop throughout the course of the show and as they develop, I feel they all get better.

Their all ordinary people with ordinary powers (well except for Eleven but she not invincible) but all work well with whatever they have, to the best of their ability, but also their best weapon which is their wits and teamwork. None of them asked to be thrust into the strange predicaments nor even to save our realm from evil, but here they are, and they always give it their all and watch each other's backs in the process.

I'll describe a couple of my favorites since there is so many.

Mike he's great, he's sort of the leader of the bunch. His character I can really relate to as he's a bit like myself in real life. I like that his character is a geek but he's not the stereotypical kind, despite playing a lot of D and D and pop culture he open minded to other things outside of those things.

What I love about him is he has strong emotions, he isn't afraid to do what is right and what he knows must be done which makes him a guy with plenty of guts.

Eleven is also great really like the actress Millie Bobby Brown who looks like Natalie Portman when she was that age. She sort of a young Jean Grey as she is armed with her psychic powers which are cool as we see them in action, though her powers do have their limitations as it puts strain on her physically which is where she gets constant nose bleeds which at times makes me concerned for her, but this limitation just reminds us how human she truly is.

She's a character that constantly evolves throughout the show, as well as the most sympathetic, despite being so young so much of her life has been taken from her. Which in a way makes us even more want to bet on her to win not just against evil but in being able to discover and make a life for herself.

It's funny and interesting seeing her orient herself with even the littlest conveniences, which makes sense when you think about it. But I really like how she slowly but surely opens as she spends more time with her friends the Strange Raiders.

Mike and Eleven are one of my favorite fictional couples up there with Hikaru and Misa from ""Macross"", Tom Paris and Elena from ""Star Trek Voyager"" and others in my book. Despite so young, their interaction and feelings for one another are beautiful and strong. Both really can open up to one another that they can't do with anyone else and we see how slowly and gradually it becomes something more.

Even like how both react toward it where they both don't totally understand it all and it's strange to them, but also exciting and fascinating they both just stop thinking and go with it. I also feel both are truly good for one another as they not just watch each other's back but also make each other strong as their interaction motivates them to do more or break whatever limits them.

Life truly can be strange and wonderful all at once.

Rating: 4 stars"
Nickelodeon has better shows with better scenarios and acting. Acting in season 3 is worst than some cartoons or even video games. Rubbish for the braindead.
"All these complains like the story remind people on nightmare on elmstreet, IT etc - guys hellloooo !!! - this whole series is an hommage to the 80s. They brought all the famous horror/mystery movies in one story! Absolutely well done and Episode 7 started to bring everything together - I really start believing it does no end in an absolute mess like Game of Thrones - I am maximal excited seeing the episodes in July!"
"Here are some ideas for improving season 4:

1. Kill Erica 2. Kill Max"
Amazing series with Spielberg vision of parallel world existence with the Hint of Steven Kings script.
"Season 1 and 2 were outstanding. The 1st season being the best. It's written for all ages, not just young teens. It had great horror scenes, smart writing and the characters were likeable. Season 3 isn't terrible, it did somewhat get better after the first couple of episodes. But it's definitely no where near as good as S1/S2.

They changed the characters too much. No adult viewer wants to watch two children make out all day. In what world would Hopper ever allow them to make out all day in her bedroom and let bratty Mike talk to him the way he did? Hopper used to have a back bone. I miss the old Hopper. Mike has become the most annoying character. I hope season 4 is going to steer clear of the child/teenage soap opera storyline and get back to it's roots."
"I was hooked to this show after first episode, I loved first season and its best till date, season 2 had good strory/plot but poorly executed, and now the 3rd one, one of the most overhyped season of 2019, can't tell how terrible season 3 is. Characters are Plot-armored, and Fighting scenes just doesn't make any sense. Very poor story, Russian can make those high-tech industry in the middle of US, but can't afford Surveillance Cameras. LOL and I want to write many Plot-holes in S3 but I won't because since season 1 this show is filled with full of plot holes, I've stopped watching this show at moment in Episode 6 where i sees Nancy and Jonathan unharmed after all that beating by those Zombies. LOL even anime shows makes more sense than this total Garbage."
"It's been quite a while between season 3 and season 4, and coming back to it feels so nice! I love this show, the creativity, the songs, the 80's vibe but most of all the characters and story. Season 4 gets a lot more darker and gory but it's still very much the world of stranger things with the same atmosphere. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and stepping back in the world of Stranger Things, makes me appreciate it even more, will forever be one of my very few favorites I have come to realise. Thank you Duffer brothers!"
This is the best series I've ever watch After dark best sci-fi thriller A must watch for all.
"I have watched this series since it first came on Netflix. Season 1 was brilliant. It captivated me, and when it was over I only wanted more. Season 2 gave me more, but to be honest it wasn't as good as the first season. It wasn't bad. It just didn't floor me like the first season did. Season 3 was better than season 2. The Mall nostalgia made it particularly interesting. However, it still didn't truly match the brilliance of season 1. Season 4 didn't match it either. Season 4 exceeded the brilliance of season 1. Season 4 introduced us to the story's antagonist, which up until now was simply a mysterious malevolence inhabiting a universe parallel to our own. Now, we know it for the evil it truly is. I was wondering if the show was slowly running out of steam. Now I know it isn't. I can hardly wait for the fifth and final season."
"I was first aware of ""Stranger Things"" after the buzz surrounding the clip of the kids reacting to the Golden Globe nominations in 2016, it was a cute moment that (retrospectively) captured the charm of the show.

Then there was David Harbour's speech at the SAG ceremony with Winona Ryder (still in character?) making the weirdest faces. Winning the ensemble award was a signal confirmed by the show progressively becoming the phenomenon of the year before being temporarily dethroned by Netflix' other youth-oriented but more socially-loaded ""13 Reasons Why"". Still, despite all these encouragements to curiosity, if it was up to me, I'm not sure I would have watched the series. I'm not the series' buff.

But my wife is... and I registered to Netflix, her attention span is a better match for the series' format and thankfully, I never had to complain about her choices. And yesterday, we had just finished our nine-hours of ""Stranger"" binge-watching, over a span of ten days. And well, the show is good, quite good, Actually, it's ""2010's"" good and ""1980's"" good.

You can't ignore the 80's thing, the series surfs across all the canvas of its flashy Pop Culture but with such a gusto and brilliance you could really believe this is a 80's classic. The only thing that slightly betrays the series is how the kaleidoscope of 80's is so persistent at times you can't dodge the feeling of a certain self-awareness from the authors, the Duffer brothers, there are at times an 'overuse' of reminders that we're not in the 2010's, but I guess this isn't an artistic license, it is a necessity.

In fact, it's just as if the Duffer brothers didn't draw their inspiration upon the well of the decade nostalgia, the series would've been another soul-less rip-off of ""Lost"" or ""American Horror Story"". And let's not forget that the show wouldn't have worked the same if the kids had cell-phones or behaved like today's generation Z. Maybe there's a generational commentary after all, reminding me of Marge Simpson's question ""do kids still go on bike rides?"" a time where dungeons and dragons were played with cards, where a kid wanted to be a Ghostbuster and not having the most likes on Facebook.

Netflix came up with two shows that said a lot about how kids have changed in three decades, but ""Stranger Things"" doesn't go for social relevance, not directly anyway, the real deal is within the story and never ceases to amaze you by the level of creativity and inventiveness injected into each episode. Sure, there are many archetypes that don't just belong to the 80's, you have the mysterious girl, a chosen one with hidden powers, you have the supernatural occurrences for starters, a group of kids with various personalities. But just when you're thinking ""oh, I've seen that before"", there's a new twist popping out on the screen or something that either thickens the plots or deepens the relationships, stuff which, while looking vaguely familiar, feels weirdly new and fresh with that 2010's/1980's feeling?

Take the group of kids, you have the straight one (Finn Wolfhard), the goofy one (Gaten Matarazzo), the seemingly token black kid (Caleb McLaughlin) but there's never a moment where you feel they're here to play archetypes. The presence of Sean Astin reminded me that even in ""The Goonies"", you could feel the Spielbergian over-the-top touch, too many gadgets, too much cockiness, these kids in ""Stranger Kids"" feel closer to a certain reality, we would believe kids would act that way in the 80's, just like we would believe in the everyday and homely realism of the folks leaving in the neighborhood.

For such a fantasy and sci-fi driven series, to feel that real is quite an achievement, but the soul of its success relied on one hit-or-miss character: Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. You see, I've never been a fan of all these girl power tropes, but Brown plays such a nuanced character that she practically defines the perfect sense of balance in the Duffer brothers' vision, at times, she's bad ass, other times, vulnerable but never in a ""Hit Girl"" way. You really feel for her and the chemistry with every other character makes the whole thing work.

""Lost"" was a bit like that before it drowned itself in a maze of intricacies. I wish ""Strangers Things"" will keep on this trajectory, after two seasons and so many thrills, I wish it won't just get too wrapped up in its obsession to duplicate every element of the 80's. And while served by a good cast of known faces like Wynona Ryder, Harbour and Astin, the series is a vehicle for great emerging talents and I guess I wouldn't be wrong in assuming that Brown will be Oscar nominated before reaching her 20's. She's that good.

So ""Stranger Things"" is the typical case of a new and original recipe made of traditional ingredients, it's a salad of familiar elements, but it's digestible, and at times delicious... and it makes you realize how fast time flies, remember in the 80's, there was a wave of nostalgia over the 60's (""Dirty Dancing"", ""Stand By Me""...) when baby boomers were looking at the good old times. Imagine that in ""Stranger Things"", the oldest main actors were born in the 70's and now we're looking at the 80's as the good old days, and watching the show, I remembered the TV of my childhood. Even the theme has that ominous V-like tempo and the series that crappy VHS look.

Still, the special effects that had the wisdom not to be too 80's. Again, that sense of balance... the Duffer brothers know how to play it like in the 80's, and when not to... and the mark of the best directors is to make the strangest things out of familiar elements. And the best."
"A kids stories for kids, played by kids, and might have also been written and directed by kids. There's some foul languages though, so this maybe (I guess) for kids over 12 years old. I hate when a movie uses jumpscares which add nothing to story line is a strong indicator for bad writing/directing. It most always go together with temper tantrum, close calls, coincidences, stupid simple logic fails (no common-sense), etc. cliches you will get from B- grade movies. Postive side, a bit over acting but overall actingwise are quite good."
"Stranger things is a programme that provides scifi, horror, violence, romance and some comedy. This is an easy binge watch, I definitely recommend."
I love this show and I don't understand the bad reviews for season 3 i think that's my favourite season or at least second favourite idk but i really enjoyed it one thing I don't really like is what they did to hopers charecter he was annoying and angry all the time for no reason and never listened to Joyce I really hated his charecter this season and was happy he died ( but I guess he is not dead anymore ) but yeah I love the show.
"Season 1 is an outstanding piece of TV no doubt, Then the problem became the kids , they grew il way to fast and they stand at 6ft tall. They should have made all the episodes right away... Season 2 is good, far from the one but way better than Season 3. So I dont know what to think, of course its NOT the Greatest show but for today TV standard its a good show, because we dont have a lot of good tv nowaday.

8/10 because 9/10 and 10/10 are for the Iconic series like Lost Breaking Bad X files."
"This series was a great mixture of several genres done in a style similar to horror and sci-fi movies from the eighties. It didn't quite hook me right away, but because it was so talked about, I kept on going. I'm glad I finished it, because the payoff was worth it. I think every episode had at least one moment that made me think of E.T. I also thought it had a similar feel to an old show called Tales From The Darkside--strange things were going on, but it didn't quite cross completely into horror territory. My favorite characters were Eleven-- of course--and Dustin. The whole thing just made me want to ride my bike around my old neighborhood and play Dungeons and Dragons all night long. It was pretty special, and I didn't just enjoy it--I'm thankful for it."
"The best and auspicious movie of netflix so far. Season 1 and 2 was incredible... Little bit disappointed after watching 3, that doesn't mean it was bad. It was far better than other web series..In short; hatsoff to this series. One must watch it... Highly recommended. 1 star less for just the ending of season 3 , otherwise i have rated it 10/10."
"Daaaaaang. Stranger things may just be the greatest television show of all time. So many things are overrated and over-hyped that I almost given up all hope about buzz and cr$p like that. But so many people told me about it and finally I pulled the trigger on the first season about a week before the release of season two and then literally binge watched season two in one day. Nine hours of awesome. Season one is, of course, slightly better but just by a few hairs. I hope they end it on season three. I just want them to conclude it before the quality drops."
"As anticipated, so delivered. Season 4 of ""Stranger Things"" flowed along all the right action-adventure lanes with sci-fi and horror highlights artfully interwoven with the core plot.

Volume 1 comprised episodes 1-7, and the final two episodes of the season will be airing on July 1 2022 - based on the show's IMDB page.

Directors for the first seven episodes - the Duffer Brothers, Shawn Levy, Nimród Antal - did captivating work this season. Writers - the Duffer Brothers, Caitlin Schneiderhan, Paul Dichter, Kate Trefry, Curtis Gwinn - did an outstanding job working all the required details into a stellar script that is sure to satisfy fans and sundry.

Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein continued to regale with their enchanting musical scoring work. All those 80s inspired soundtracks were amazing as well. I'm already a Kate Bush fan, so it was nice to see them give her song ""Running Up That Hill"" ('Hounds Of Love', 1985) prominence.

Caleb Heymann, Brett Jutkiewicz, and others did superb work on cinematography. Admirable editing, hair-makeup, and stunts kept the season going strong. The crews who worked on art direction and set decoration deserve praise. Chris Trujillo's production design was outstanding.

The costume design department truly captured the 80s once again - their work practically teleported me back to that era. Sound effects aside, the VFX team also brought their A-game to ""Stranger Things"" Season 4, now streaming on Netflix.

Eleven (alias, Jane), played by Millie Bobby Brown, was superb. Joyce Byers, played by Winona Ryder, was noteworthy. Jim Hopper, played by David Harbour, was remarkable. Dustin Henderson, played by Gaten Matarazzo, was memorable. Lucas Sinclair, played by Caleb McLaughlin, was great. Mike Wheeler, played by Finn Wolfhard, was good.

Will Byers, played by Noah Schnapp, was also good. Jonathan Byers, played by Charlie Heaton, was barely given any room to perform this season. Steve Harrington, played by Joe Keery, was notable. Nancy Wheeler, played by Natalia Dyer, was amazing. Dr. Martin Brenner, played by Matthew Modine, was quite good. Maxine Mayfield, played by Sadie Sink, was memorable.

Robin Buckley, played by Maya Hawke, was quite good. Suzie, played by Gabriella Pizzolo, was also good. Jason Carver, played by Mason Dye, was notable. Murray Bauman, played by Brett Gelman, was amazing. Erica Sinclair, played by Priah Ferguson, was great.

Sam Owens, played by Paul Reiser, was quite good. Eddie Munson, played by Joseph Quinn, was underrated. Yuri, played by Nikola Djuricko, was quite good. Victor Creel, played by Robert Englund, was a pleasant surprise.

Playing the main villain Vecna was Jamie Campbell Bower who was amazing in the role - his body language, in particular. It was fascinating to watch his 'origin story' in which he was revealed to be Modine's first experimental test subject '001'. Eleven was the direct cause of his being flung into the Upside Down wherein he was transformed into the undead thing he is shown to be in Season 4.

All other cast and crew did praiseworthy work in Season 4 of ""Stranger Things"" for Netflix.

This season saw a lot of 'Upside Down' coverage - every detail in there was fantastic - with a strong reveal of the show's 'big bad', Vecna. It saw some notable historical mentions, like how they linked the Dungeons & Dragons board game to ill-founded satanic connections and other negative psychological instances among the youth of the time.

This was the darkest season yet in the ""Stranger Things"" lineup. I loved every minute of it, mainly because of the sheer attention to detail that went into its making. They produced this season as if it were their last, and left no entertainment-stone unturned. Some good use of ASMR techniques as well.

Most of the main characters received admirable progression. The season was perfectly paced - the wonders of extended runtimes. The show involved a plethora of detailed plot layers and script sequences. It only enhanced the overall entertainment value of Netflix ""Stranger Things"" Season 4.

That almost-finale now has me searching for 'gates' into a possible 'Right Side Up' for the 2-episode conclusion come July, and Season 5 of ""Stranger Things""."
"It is great, but still a bit overrated. I think its rating is based less on its quality and more on nostalgia for the '80s that it brings. It pulls many elements from legendary shows and movies from the '80s and it's an obvious homage to Stephen King and movies like ""E.T."", ""It"", ""Golden Child"", ""Lost Boys"", etc. I'm not thrilled, but I am very satisfied. I enjoyed it and I'm very eager for the next season.

8/10"
"I started watching because my sister recommended it to me. I thought stranger things was going to be another shallow teenage drama, but boy was I wrong. This show is actually good. The acting of the entire cast is amazing. There's not one bad actor. It's a scifi/fantasy series set in the 80s, which reminds me a bit of early Spielberg movies.

Here are the few negative things I have to say. The story develops slowly in the beginning of every season. I hope the story line will be different in season 4 because I noticed the stories of season 1, 2 and 3 are all very much alike. It's getting predictable.

In general an amazing show that you won't regret watching."
"If Stephen King and Steven Spielberg had a lovechild, this would be it; there are sprinklings of other franchises too such as ET and Cthulhu. It is not simply an homage though, it delivers its own unique universe with wonderfully crafted characters and well written stories. In addition the beautiful sets, bright color palette and choice of music enhance this with a solid 80s vibe.

There are many marvellous performances, in season one Winona Ryder and David Harbour are excellent. Of course Millie Bobby Brown is a big favourite as Eleven, but her destiny has been obvious since her little-known, but fabulous breakout performance in Intruders.

Season one is superb, subsequent seasons are good, but the spine-chilling sinister sense of the unknown is diluted. It is replaced by some creative character development and a storytelling style that is compelling, touching and humorous.

Very much looking forward to the imminent release of season four."
"I started watching stranger things and got hooked. I enjoyed season 1 and season 2 sooo soooo much. I enjoyed every episode and every episode left me in a really good mood.

AND THEN... THE WHOLE SERIES WERE RUINED FOR ME. Season 3 is such non sense. Such a stupid and plot. I have a hard time understanding that there is 1 single person on planet earth that could enjoy season 3... As a few other reviews said, season 3 feels more like a parody of season 1 and season 2....

ANOTHER GREAT SHOW RUINED!!!"
"Parallel Dimensions, the 80's, Kids on an adventure that's pure entertainment. Seasons 1&2 were brilliant, season 3 dragged a bit. Awaiting season 4. It's a treat to watch Winona Ryder after so long."
They should finish with season 2. Loved first two hated the third.
"Loved season 1. Can't recall much about season 2, it was more of the same. Was disappointed with season 3.

Loathing season 4.

Everything which was good about the start of the story is gone. The charming characters, the mystery, even the 80s nostalgia.

Instead, we get splash-in-your-face gore, cringe-inducing dialogues, run-of-the-mill Russian baddies, black-jelly-soaked monsters.

Are things so morally bad in America that an entire school finds it amusing to watch a helpless female student being brutally bullied and ridiculed, cheering on for the bullies and booing the one being brutalised? Is this normal? And what's up with people torturing each other all the time? Is this the authors' social commentary on the state of their society or some bizarre private obsessions with bullying and torture?

I can't recommend this show past season 3, it's now atrocious."
"After 2 great seasons and moderate expectations I was at stage to wanna skip parts of last series of season 3.

First, the production value is great, no question about. However, once great story, characters and horror now feels plastic, overdone with unbelievable cringe and stupidity. Russians in American Mall wearing military outfits - really!? Half of our heroes act like they suddenly lost ability to think. Acting is superb but the material is literally garbage. 80s referring are ok, again with overkill. I'm guessing this is the main reason for the high reviews.

Sincerely hope that they will return our heroes to what they ware.

p.s. real score for the season is 4, 3 is more as a statement"
"The fantastic thing about this series is the children. Terrific, scene-stealing performances from all four of them. Nailed nerdy boys, abused girl, budding romance, and everything in-between.

But the story itself -ugh? Derivative drivel. A federal institution with this level of interest is handled poorly by a small cadre of ""scientists."" If this kind of operation were to occur, it would be handled in a much more sophisticated manner, even back in the day. The kids out-running the police story device is not believable. Just too many warmed over tropes.

Harbour's hard-bitten, sullen demeanor feels dialed in. Winona plays what seems to me a high-pitched parody of Owen Wilson. Neither of their performances moved me positively. Paired together they are almost believable. Even then, that they succeed where better trained personnel fail miserably is just sophomoric.

The kids compel - the story is poor and the adults are merely staging."
"Season 1 was literally perfect, however during season 2 and 3 it lost it's touch.

But to be honest, season 4 was so good. Episode 4 was literally incredible, people that disagree have no clue what they're talking about."
"Although there are some logical imprecisions, they do not hinder the overall perception. The little actors are very good at acting. The suspense is intriguing."
"It had some moments in the beginning. You can see from the get go that the plot is pretty forced. They closed the gate in s2 after all, right? Now the Soviets appeared lead by the Terminator and try to reopen the gate without absolutely anyone, including the FBI/ CIA noticing. Weak!

By s3 the show transformed into a goofy comedy a la Scooby doo. Russians wander all over town and nobody notices. We're talking about random small town in the USA, not New York or LA. People disappear and nobody notices. Kids wander around secret underground lab and nobody notices. The worst in my opinion is what the mind flayer did in the end: assimilated all people and turned into a big useless monster that got fooled by a bunch of kids. That was his grand plan to kill eleven? It could have captured all of them if it retained all the individual pieces. I'm not even going comment on the political agenda or the not-so-subtle product placement. At this point the only way it can be worse is if they try to make s4. Watch it for the nostalgia and the few good moments here and there, but nothing more. In conclusion, I got bored watching the last episode of s3. So disappointed compared to s1 and 2."
"The show had great character development and is quite scary sometimes. The ending of season 3 was quite emotional as well. And,sometimes it can get funny.but why I would not give it 10/10 is because a few relationships in season 3 did not work for me. That's my only flaw other than that this show is phenomenal."
"I don't want to include spoilers here, so there won't be any details on how I feel about the plot. However, acting is so far very shallow, without direction, painfully trying to revive the ghosts of the past but failing. Timing is abysmal, the story drags it's hobbled little feet like it's been mauled with an axe. After first episode I said ""ok, we'll see..."" Now, I'm having trouble finishing the second in two attempts. Oh boy, did this show really have to crash so sadly? MBB is trying so hard (and failing) that I feel embarrassed for her. What was a good match for the first season proves to be a failure in third - she-actress actually didn't ""play"" an empty-shell character, she IS empty and it shows."
"The theme of this show is so simple that you can call it a kid TV series but when you enter the world of ST then you realise that this is something beyond then the kids show. Every aspects of this series gives you different vibe and make your watch exciting. Specially the characters of this series are memorable. The bond they have the chemistry they give and the emotions this shows carries on is just never seen before. Till now this series hasn't disappoint us and I hope it gets more and more complicated and deliver the unexpected. The story of this series is just out of the box you can't predict, you can't imagine and that's the best part of this show that it's engage till the end of the episode and you'll want more and more. Show doesn't require any reviews because the hardwork always pays off. Just see if you haven't watched it. Because in the world of shows. This show comes on top and can become one of the best show ever..."
"Season one was fantastic, season 2 kept things rolling. Season 3 is a poor concept riddled with inconsistent and weak characters (hopper, Joyce and max, Will), drawn out far too long and wrapped up so badly that a group of high schoolers could have done a better job. Haven't been so let down by a show's ending since how I met your mother."
I believe stranger things is a show made to please the average audience
"Stranger Things is one of if not the best thing Netflix has made television wise. Although the 3rd wasn't my particular favorite, it was still awesome. The characters are highly likeable, the plot is very good, Its creepy but has a 80s feel to it. It is definitely a soon to be classic and I highly recommend it to anyone."
I want new season right now I waited almost 2 yearssss?? This show is pretty good. The story keeps you glued and I absolutely love the characters. There are still many mysteries yet to be solved. In my opinion S3>S1>S2.
"One of the best horror thriller series i have ever watched. Excellent sound work and graphics , season 1 is excellent when compared to season 2 . Comedy worked out pretty good . Script wise I didn't like season 3 and felt pathatic but horror thrill , sound was excellent on season 3 . I Recommend it to watch during with good sound system."
"Loved season 1, season 2 was ok, but season 3 is cringeworthy and bad. I only watched all 8 episodes because of my wife. The overuse of El's power kind of ruined it. The addition of new characters was fine but at times, too many and too much, the original 4 get shut out. Not going waste time with 4th season."
"I want to state that I LOVE this show. It's my fav9rite one on Netflix for sure but I wanted to be honest in my review. Honest and thorough.

*SPOILER ALERT*

1). I am a HUGE fan of this series but had an issue with season 3. I have just 1 question. Where were the parents to ANY of these kids at? I mean SERIOUSLY! I was raised in the 80's. I had to be in the house before the street lights came on. As far as I know, there were I think 2 kids who actually had their friends cover for them and 1 of them wasn't even part of the original gang.

2). There were more cuss words (the ""S"" word in particular) in one episode than there were in the entire first 2 seasons. Okay, it is a little bit of an exaggeration but once you watch it, you sill see. Season 3 episode 5 is a particularly ""colorful"" one, to say the least.

3). When there is 7:37 left in S3E5 ""chapter 5, The Flayed"", what is up with Nancy's half hearted (I wanted to say something other than hearted but decided to keep it child friendly) run??? You have a psychopath chasing you with super strength and you basically speed walk down the hallway for help? They are in a hospital. Why not let out a blood curdling scream?

4). Hospitals have back up generators. Why were the lights flickering like for so dang long?

5). I know it's a small town but NOBODY saw the giant bloody alien thing being flung out a 3rd story emergency room entrance window at the hospital? Nobody? Not a Dr, nurse, patient, patient's families, security guard, receptionist, deli worker, heck, not even a gift shop employee?

6). In S3E6, Robin spits in the Russian General's face. After she did, immediately afterwards, he wiped it off with a handkerchief that just happened to be in his hand at the time. Why not spend a couple of seconds showing him grabbing it out of his pocket?"
"About Stranger Things, I looked forward to this series. But as my rating suggests, it did not deliver.

First let me say I am no longer young. Second, I am not so old that I need a film to be explained to me. But I simply did not understand much of what was going on in the final three episodes.

More important however was that the characters never seemed to act like real people. Particularly the adults. Case in point, one mother and father in the series never go into their son's room - not once. If they had they'd have discovered with whom he'd been sharing that space and well, that would ruin the story. So, I understand the 'why', but I think it could have been handled lots better.

As for the kids' acting; really terrible.

Finally, if there was one more scene of the kids jumping onto their bikes I would have screamed. In fact, I did."
"... Obviously they have new writers for Season 3. What used to be mysterious, intriguing and provocative is now as imaginative, sophisticated and engaging as an old ""Three's Company"" rerun."
"This has to be regarded as oke of the greatest series out there. Everything in the production is just blowned-away good. It took the streaming culture to another level with its thrilling story.

Its not just the great actors and filming of the well sorted out environment that makes this so amazing. The music is more then well composed. It fits everything so well and gets even closer with the entire story. It gives a deep into the atmosphere and brings big excitement.

This series has aswell captured the 80s very close to reality. Its like we all traveled back to the 80s and its captured perfectly, which ads to the story."
Third season was a big disappointment. It's boring and it doesn't make sense!! It was a great series but now it's a normal Netflix teen drama with stupid and unbelievable characters. They should have stopped in season 2.
"So... the happy go lucky kids from the former seasons are now all losers and being bullied (the bullies are losers too). The nice primary colors and cinematography from before are now as dark and brown as the story. The fun has now been switched out for teenage angst.

It's actually so boring that it gets uncomfortable to watch. I don't know how the writers can destroy a once fun and fresh concept this much. But, they actually managed to make it into total garbage."
Totally lost the thrill element of season 1. The whole teen relationship thing seemed forced. Joyce and Hopper turned out to into the most annoying characters. Too much of comedy with most of them in awkward and unnecessary places.
"Stranger Things is a very well-made show. The acting is fantastic (especially from the children), it's cinematography is beautiful and it's great at creating a feeling of dread.

By all means, Stranger Things should be phenomenal, but it has one huge flaw, a flaw which I believe derails the show.

The Duffer Brothers claim the show is a love-letter to 80s Sci-Fi. After watching this show, I can confirm that The Duffer Brothers have no idea what a homage is.

A homage shows respect to a previous decade/genre, but Stranger Things doesn't do that. Stranger Things goes the Scary Movie/Seth MacFarlane route of excessively referencing other works. This wouldn't be such a problem if the references weren't so blatant or frequent.

The show loves to name drop (""Maybe she's an escaped loony?"" ""Just like Michael Myers!"", ""I was making out with Chrissy Carpenter.), place movie posters in the background or foreground (The Thing, The Evil Dead) or sometimes even lift scenes directly from other works (The scene where Mike hides Eleven from his mother is almost identical to a scene in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial).

Stranger Things feels like it was created by that one annoying kid everybody knew who thought he was so cool because he had some knowledge of popular culture before his time.

A big disappointment for somebody who was hoping for a lot more."
"I heard about this series and really was looking forward to seeing it, but I was very disappointed.

First of all, there's no way it gets as high a rating as it has without every Netflix employee going on and giving it a ten.

IMDb is great, but it can't stop the fraud going on here.

But back to the series. I watched all 8 episodes, hoping it would get better, but it only go worse.

Now I know why Winona Ryder hasn't had many offers lately. She's a terrible actress. The whole time she has this facial expression like she's a deer in the headlights. It's very annoying to watch her pretend to be obsessed with finding her son.

Actually, none of the characters were properly developed. None are likable, except maybe the sheriff.

And as several others noted, this is a ripoff of every horror, scifi story ever written.

Can't anyone come up with something original and well written?"
"This series is the best thing on television. Thank you Duffer Brothers for making such an amazing thriller, horror, mystery, and action series with just the right amount of comedy, romance and nostalgia. We love Stranger Things! Every season has been brilliant!

...Also thank you again for not ruining it by keeping it going on and on just for money whilst the plot disintegrates like Lost, Heroes, and many other once great ruined series."
"I mean, just wow after ep 7, season 4!!!

Blew me away!!! Best series!!! 1 july please

Its gory, scary, funny and real! I miss the 80:ies!! I was 13 in 1985, oh the memories."
"Wow!! What a load of dross season 3 is. Annoying kids, thick really thick characters who can't see what is coming. A 'small' town (small towns in the US look like medium size cities elsewhere) that has so much going on with a not so scary monster that I assume most of the residents are comatose ( maybe after watching Lost in Space). I didn't expect reality but a secret Russian laboratory deep underground in the US? Doesn't say much for Homeland Security. Or how about the same lab when run by the Americans abandoned with nothing much as a security guard especially after what happened in the previous two seasons. Poor poor scriptwriting making the characters look dumb."
"I have seen a lot of new shows make their debut on network TV, Premium Cable, and of course streaming services like Amazon and Netflix. But this... Phenomenal show, imo best new show of 2016. The whole cast is excellent but Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers deserves Emmy Award consideration next year. Her being a Hollywood actress i expected great but this was masterclass character work. Winona has had some exception performances over two decades but this was one of the best of her career, maybe top 5 in her career. Also the performance from child actress Millie Brown as El aka Eleven is also amazing and is the 2nd best performance behind Ryder. This isn't the first show of this current generation to try and capture a artistic, creepy, and psychological noir style of an 80's film vibe... but unlike the others it nailed it perfectly. The first season is literally flawless in all phases ( only the snarkiest of reviewers and critics will find something to nitpick ). This is a must watch for everyone. Season 1 was only 2nd to Person Of Interest's 5th and final season on my ""Best season of any show this year"" List."
"A masterpiece?

You got to be kidding me!

A comedy for kids rife with teen age sexual tendencies."
"Season 4 volume 1 is fantastic. I love how the duffer brothers have slowly increased the horror and gore as the characters got older which enabled a more sinister take on the upside down world.

These kids are now in high school so the natural progression of the show would to make it around a 15 certificate which then allows it to move along with how the cast have grown up. Great work.

You can tell the duffer brothers were heavily influenced on classic 80s horrors when they were young, from the score, the settings and the main protagonist!"
"I watched this web series 3 months ago. And I still remember the effect which it put in my mind. It has a very nice concept and story. Although it had some loopholes which were nothing as compared to the whole web series. First coming to its story it has many twists and turns and most of them were unpredictable. The pacing is slow in first 1-2 episodes of all the seasons. But then the pace increases and then keeps you hook until the end. Talking about the acting, all have acted very well especially Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard and David Harbour. The technical aspects of the web series were also good. The web series is outstanding in its emotional aspects especially when all friends unite with each other or the bond between two characters . Moreover the intro theme of the web series is also great which gives you goosebumps. The climax of all three seasons were good. There were some scenes which were somewhat illogical or did not have any explanation. But when you watch the whole web series you will not care about these small things. Overal I can say this is a must watch web series especially if you love watching sci-fi and fantasy web series because it keeps you hooked until the end when the pacing increases."
"I suppose if you are under 14 years old you could accept it. But then again you wouldn't ""remember"" the 80's tacky pop music that saturates almost every scene. But oh yes don't forget it's a ""slow burn"" where almost every character is either annoying or wacky or both. I'm sorry but I don't buy it."
Puts me in a 80s euphoric place with the script. Can't get enough!
"Season 4 is mediocre, at best, and I do speak as a fan of the series and not some random hater. Had this show started that way (quality-wise) would its status be the same? Let's be honest, first two seasons were amazing and they do remain the reason people are interested to this day (myself included)

Of course, it is ok to like, or even go crazy about season 4, because we all have things we don't feel objective about. However, are indeed its new characters the same fascinating? Don't you think acting from most of the cast appears a bit stale? Don't you feel the episodes stretch a bit longer than should?

Netflix was great but it starts turning into hot rubbish. If it wasn't for the Witcher, Ragnarok and a few TV fave oldies, I am pretty sure I'd have forgotten its existence by now."
"I was a teenager when the series started. Then, I liked it. Season 4 came around and I had long since lost interest; let's face it, its just a franchise; not really a show for adults. I didn't plan on seeing any of it. Unfortunately, due to family watching it, I have caught a lot of it.

The show is just tiresome. It's the same thing over and over. The script is the most infuriating part. It tries to make you feel every emotion within the space of five minutes, and this cycles throughout episodes. Every line of dialogue is cloying sentiment or a slick quip. Something terrible happens, then there's a lame joke. There's no room to breathe. I'm not sure the characters have distinct personalities as a result of this. I also feel the series relies too heavily on a gimmick, that being 1980s nostalgia. It's gaudy and mind-numbing. Don't waste your time."
"It's good but if you've watched a lot of similar tv shows it's not as good as them. I wouldn't say it is as good as people make it out to be, however if this is your genre then I would definitely recommend you to check it out!"
"Loved the first 3 seasons - definitely all 10's. They were awesome! Idk what happened with season 4 V-1. One minute it felt like I'm watching Nightmare on Elm Street, then the Night King shows up from GOT. Next comes the Ring, Prison Break, and the Karate Kid.

This series kept me on the edge of my seat. But season 4 bored me to death. Hopper's story line felt like a total waste of time. Almost everything that happened in Russia put me to sleep. The rest of the story bounces all over the place and I hate seeing the same scene over and over again. Just when I thought it was picking up, we switch to another scene that's basically worthless.

I don't get why they use multiple writers for different episodes. Episode 5 for example is a different writer and it shows. If you have 1-2-3 however many writers, they should have a place in every episode. It keeps the rhythm going and I guarantee there wouldn't be so many repetitive and boring scenes. So disappointed.

I pray Volume 2 is better."
It was a brilliant horror series. All charectors are very selective. Expecially Dustin I love him
Engaging series ive been binge watched whole seasons waiting for season 4.
"STRANGER THINGS 4

WHAT'S GOOD :

1. Every single season of Stranger Things has been an engrossing affair, it's a show that never disappoints, and this season the story gets even better as we further unravel the alternate dimension, and meet the monster who hides beneath it. Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer are exceptionally talented filmmakers, and it's truly our privilege that we are witnessing this masterpiece created by them. This season is much longer than the previous ones, but not for a moment does it feel slow or boring. In addition to all the elements that we look for in Stranger Things, this season has an additional thread that remains shrouded in mystery till the seventh episode where it shocks you and leaves you in a state of disbelief as it reveals itself. This season is an edge of the seat thriller with moments that leave you gasping for breath.

2. This season was almost like a cathartic release for the all the fans of Game of Thrones, because this is what should have happened in that show. Game of Thrones should have given the Night King a scary voice, a powerful backstory and ultimately a duel with Jon Snow. It adds so much more value to a villain and his rivalry with the heroes if there is a reason behind him acting the way he does. The voice of Jamie Campbell, his body language and the expressions that he makes can send chills down your spine; he is exactly the kind of scary villain that a show like Stranger Things needed. Whatever the show has done so far in its previous seasons has been great, but regardless of how good your special effects are, there is no match for a villain in a human form.

3. I was really happy to see the spotlight on Sadie Sink this season. Sadie is such a good actress and has been doing some really good work ever since she joined the show, but somehow she hasn't received the same amount of adulation as the others; so it felt really good to see her at the centre of attention this season. In the past seasons, we have seen Max as a happy and sarcastic girl, but this season required her to do some emotionally charged scenes, and to say that she did well would be a serious understatement. This exquisitely beautiful girl, who looks like the human form of autumn, absolutely knocked it out of the park in this season. Sadie was extremely believable in every single mental and emotional state of hers and left me heartbroken and in tears by the end of the season.

4. For the most part, this season did not provide Mike, Will and Lucas to do much, but when it did, Will and Lucas just hit it out of the park. In this season, Noah got the chance twice and he delivered beautifully both times. But it was Lucas, who stunned me with his brilliance, as he cried for help with Max closing her eyes in his arms. That was such a disturbing and painful sequence, I just couldn't hold back my tears. Unbelievable performance given by Caleb McLaughlin.

5. This season had some great new characters added to the show. Eduardo Franco as Argyle was funny from the word go; some people might have found his talking style to be irritating, but I really liked it's uniqueness. As a supporting character he did his job quite well by providing us with humour in the most unexpected of ways. Jamie Campbell Bower as One was an extremely powerful addition to the show; it would really be an understatement to say that he had a terrifying screen presence. Nikola Djuricko as Yuri made me laugh every time he spoke something; what an actor he is, kudos to the casting team for finalizing him for the show, because he is absolutely brilliant. Yuri's facial expressions and shaking head made me laugh every single time. I had mixed feelings about the way Jason's character was written, but I guess they were trying to throw in a character who liked to behave like Tom Cruise, and ultimately there are certain characters, whom we all love to hate.

6. Grace Van Dien had an extremely likeable personality as Chrissy; this lovely girl could have been a wonderful addition to the main cast of the show, but unfortunately the writers had other plans. Joseph Quinn as Eddie Munson was an absolute cracker of an addition to the show, he was a perfect fit in our main team. Eddie had enough craziness in himself to keep the viewers entertained throughout the season; it's such a pity that the writers had to kill him off, it just feels wrong. Eddie was a good character who had great potential that could have been explored in the future. I feel both Eddie and Chrissy should have been kept alive as both of them were extremely likeable characters who fit perfectly in the world of Stranger Things.

7. Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin has turned out to be one of the best and the most interesting characters of the show. He seems to be a favourite of the Duffer Brothers, considering the length of his role, but he has truly grabbed this opportunity with both hands and made the best of it. There is not a single scene in which he disappoints, and it's always a joy to watch him on screen.

8. You can get an idea about the dedication of the showrunners towards their craft by having a look at the amount of effort they put in the simplest of sequences. In episode 6, Mike, Will and Jonathan had to visit Suzie's house to get the location of an IP address; now this scene could have been filmed in a straightforward sweet and simple way as well, with Suzie happily offering the help they needed; but the Duffer Brothers are not the kind of showrunners who would settle for an easy way out. As soon as Suzie's house door opened, the music changed, and our heroes walked right into an absolute chaos. That whole sequence was unbelievably beautiful, it felt like stepping into a completely different film. That scene goes to show the love these Duffer brothers have for Stranger Things and that they are 200 percent invested into making it completely worth your time.

9. I can't express the happiness I experienced watching the reunion of Hopper and Eleven. Both David Harbour and Millie are exceptionally talented actors, and their performance gave that scene a touch of realism, and moved me to tears. I think that scene was strategically placed to put a smile on our faces after all the disaster and heartbreak we all went through.

10. The cinematography, art direction, stunt-work, music and visual effects of this season were outstanding to say the least. Every frame looked like a piece of art; one could sense that a lot of work has gone into the making of this season. Everything was clearly visible in the night sequences, a feat that even a show like Game of Thrones couldn't achieve. The make-up done on Jamie Campbell to turn him into Vecna was incredible. All the action sequences were super impressive, but Hopper's sword fight with the Demogorgon takes the cake. The visual effects in this show have always been amazing, but this season they made it look like an actual movie. Not a lot of shows can compete with Stranger Things when it comes to music, and they have outdone themselves in this season, it's absolutely mesmerizing.

WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD :

1. Instead of Eddie, why didn't the showrunners kill off Robin played by Maya Hawke? I don't think she adds anything to the show and her character arc got over in the previous season itself. In this season, she was saying dialogues that could have been said by anyone else, and frankly speaking they should have been delivered by others instead of her interrupting them all the time. Also, her constant chatter was just irritating, it had no humour in it at all. I wonder if the showrunners are under some kind of pressure to keep her on the show? Towards the end of the season, a decent amount of time was spent on establishing the friendship between Vickie and Robin, which I felt was totally and completely unnecessary. You already have a lot of characters, you have killed off some seriously good ones, and now you wish to put some spotlight on this new relationship that no one asked for? Maya is an extremely beautiful girl and a good actress, but her character Robin has no reason to exist on the show.

2. The character of Dmitri Antonov played by Tom Wlaschiha just couldn't make any impact at all, thanks to the writers who forgot to develop the character. This is a problem that you are bound to face when you have so many characters in a show. Ever since the Hopper in Russia teaser got released, I was intrigued to know the kind of role the famous ""Jaquen H'ghar"" gets to play in this show; but unfortunately he was reduced to a single note background character with no depth at all.

3. It felt really bad to see Jonathan Byers played by Charlie Heaton being reduced to nobody. Jonathan used to be one of the central characters initially, his scenes with his mother and his brother Will were some of the most memorable scenes of the show and gave us a good idea of the acting prowess he possesses. But in this season, he was reduced to a junkie who was lost in his own world most of the time. The writers had nothing for him this season and on top of that, he is going to lose his girlfriend as well it seems.

4. This season, the writers once again brought Nancy and Steve close to each other, which I felt was just not right at all. This love story had already been resolved, why go around in circles? This is not fair on Jonathan at all. Why can't the writers find a new girlfriend for Steve? How difficult is it to introduce a new character who falls in love with him? Steve didn't really care for Nancy the way Jonathan did, he learnt a good lesson about love through that episode and now he should move on and find a nice girl for himself; it makes zero sense to go back to Nancy."
"I just completed watching the 4th season and MY GOD, all the things that the cast, crew and anyone who's been involved in ST saying that, ""This will be the greatest season yet"" it actually very much easy, matter of fact this is the best season of an returning series I've watched this year and maybe last year too and maybe after ST season 3 too.

This season has very much to offer to a fan as well as an audien. I've literally hoped that every episode in this part want to be more than 60min and iam so glad that happened.

The character arcs, the emotions and more importantly the performance of the OG gang is more than amazing. And iam surprised for a fact that the new characters they've interdouced in this season are so good that most of them made feel like they were not new at all, especially EDDIE. Joseph Quinn had a bit of nuances of Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. For the starting 2 episodes I felt like this is different, then at the end of 3rd episode I got what an ST fan would love to. The 4th episode is such a wonder to watch on-screen but the 7th episode was even more greater and superb as compared to the 4th one because we know who really are and what they were and are. After this I can't wait for the 2nd part. Already started counting days from now on. TIK TOK TIK TOK TIK TOK."
"(Season 4) I think this season started off strong and I have no issues with previous seasons, but about halfway through I felt like the story completely stalled out in an attempt to set up for season 5. I understand the necessity for build up in a multi season show especially if you know season 5 will be the end, but for 30 million an episode I expected just a tad more rounding out of season 4. At this point I had settled into the Stranger Things season formula which I really enjoyed, when season 4 departed from that I felt a little disappointed. All that aside I do really enjoy the show and I recommend it to others!

(Complete sidenote) Why did they make Robin so different? Am I the only one that felt like her character completely changed without any explanation?"
"There will always be negative reviews, no matter how great the show or movie is. I had to leave my review, just in case any of the cast, crew, or writers read these.

Thank you so much for putting together such a masterpiece. I've been a fan since day 1. I love this show! The story is original. The actors are amazing. This is just a fun show to watch!

Looking forward to season 5! Can't wait!"
"The latest series starts off very slowly and eventually picks up.

It was great to see the gang back together, a lot darker than the other series, that can be slightly frightening for a younger audience.

The CGI was excellent and knowing the producers knew exactly what to do to pull at the heart strings.

I would advise watching the other series' again, as there is a lot you will forget."
Stranger things is a very popular and trendy show especially among teenagers. I really like this show and the story is just really great. Season 1 and 2 were amazing and season 3 was good but it wasn't amazing. I love how the cast are child actors yet they are incredibly talented child actors. The characters work really well as a team but individually some of them can be kind of annoying. Although I really like this show I do think that it is overhyped. This show is great but there are many others that are just as good if not better that don't get anywhere near as much hype surrounding them. My worry about this how is that it will just get stretched out and get worse and worse.
"Love love love this show one of my all time favorite shows, the characters are amazing, the chemistry they have with each other is spectacular, I love the fact it's set in the 80s, the wardrobe is fun the cgi is good. Great show overall.10/10."
This is some of the best TV I've seen for quite some time. I would say it's more like a Steven King story rather then a Steven Spielberg movie. It's a great mix of the paranormal and sci-fi and as a fan of this kind of genre I had an idea by halfway through the series what was going on. Many of the principal characters are kids but kids stuff it certainly is not. All of the young cast are good but I think Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven really steals the show like Ellie Fanning in Super 8. I'd have to say that the sinister government agency responsible for all distress brought to the Hawkins community were rather sloppy and in reality they would have found the girl (Eleven) a lot sooner. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her. We know that Sheriff Hooper made some kind of deal with the government agents but it's not clear at this point exactly what it was. It does have a satisfactory ending but with enough loose ends for a further season. Hopefully there is enough interest in this show for a DVD release at some point. Most of the reviews (mine included) have been generally favorable and I do hope that it will have enough of an audience worldwide to give the go ahead for a series two and I also hope that we don't have to wait an entire year for it but more then likely we will.
"The first season is great but then it gets dumber and dumber. The second season wasn't as good as the first but it was watchable but the third season is terrible. It's full of stupid things and cringe scenes, the dialogues are bad and also the acting is worse. First Season 8/10, second season 5/10, third season 1/10."
"I'm a fan of Stranger Things. Its yet another retro series but this one works for a whole variety of reasons where others have failed.

First of all its well cast, with characters who have an 80's vibe. There's the stressed out working mother capably played by Winona Ryder complimented by a Goonies style group of kids who really fit their roles, right up to the 80's hairdo's and love of classically nerdy, Dungeons and Dragons.

Its good stuff backed up by sound story lines that taps into a myriad of 80's films and television series with a sci fi, horror, conspiracy theory twist.

All in all, there's a lot to like here and I hope as this series progresses, the nostalgia train rolls on offering more ""strange tales"" from the era of Ronald Regan, Thatcher and Pac Man. Eight out of ten from me."
"Season 1 was great, season 2 ok, but season 3 is trash. This show is overrated."
"Is there anything more enjoyable than chasing the strange story third season at home on the fourth day of the summer vacation ... If so, please tell me!"
"This review is for season 2, First season was a 9.5 for me. Its almost like they wanted to repeat season 1, but slightly different. So there were no real surprises, mystery or even suspense.

Often parts were overplayed and overacted, cant say too much more without spoilers, but for me was somewhat disappointing.

Edit: Just gone done watching season 3, and boy is it back on track. Wonder if they realized they ran off the rails for season 2.

Season 3 every bit as good as the first."
"1 of the best tv shows ever made, for sure the best child cast ever!! Nothing negative to say absolutely nothing!!!"
"Boy, you can surely tell the budget went up for this season. There is so much happening and every shot seems to be an expensive one, either because of the practical or digital effects.

I liked this season, but it has serious issues.

First and foremost, everything seems to drag on forever, which creates a feeling I'm eating an overstuffed turkey. Whether it's the rainbow room segments, The Sovjet storyline, all scenes seem to take up too much screen-time.

It feels as if the extra long episodes were a requirement and now suddenly the writers and director had to fill up the extra time they've been given.

Also, some characters are there but don't have a lot of interesting things to do. Will Byers and Mike Wheeler for example are plain annoying and the conflicts they have feel forced, which the directors mask by sprinkling melodrama. I've had to roll my eyes in several occasions and ask myself when the hell they were gonna shut up.

It doesn't help they've grown up. At least as kids they were cute and their actions were perceived as the ones of kids. Now they seem to act younger than they really are. But you can't really kill them off, now can you, dear directors?

I recommend the directors to reduce the episode duration to what it was before and avoid us having to sit through a single episode in multiple sessions, which also forces them to write, direct and edit with rigor.

Luckily, many of the cast members are consistently entertaining and they can still carry the show. Production quality is excellent.

Having said that, 5 seasons is plenty. We've enjoyed the show for several years and it's time to bring it to a conclusion before the overstuffed turkey burns in the oven."
"Just perfect. Magical. Outstanding direction, superb writing, gorgeous and lavish cinematography, and top notch acting."
"While I was watching the third season i kept wondering if it was a joke or not. unfortunately it wasn't, third season sucks!"
"I wasn't sure what to expect from Stranger Things because I don't really know anything about the source material. I've watched a few episodes (I'm trying to pace myself) but I can confidently say that I'm hooked, I've got to have more Stranger Things. These characters are wonderful and engrossing. Winona Ryder & David Harbour really do such a good job in this and I know working with very young actors must be challenging but these kids really bring it! I especially like how normal these characters look even though they are engrossed in such a surreal situation. This is what real sci-fi should be about. Netflix, I keep trying to find a reason to end my subscription with you but I just can't find a single one (smile!)."
"Best show ever made.

Each season just amplifies and has gotten better and better. For me the show went from good - to great - to amazing - to exceptional!

The directing is masterful, the sound design is glorious, the cgi is better than most films out there and the characters are phenomenal being to die for.

Stranger Things is movie level quality and increasing. It has every element from horror to supernatural to action. Some moments you will be laughing, others you will be crying. It's an emotional roller coaster.

I am beyond impressed with how Stranger Things is developing. Season 5 will be heart stopping and we truly aren't ready.

There's so much I can say about this season and series as a whole but I don't need to, some people will love it as much as I do, others will find it average, others will not like it. There's no right or wrong answer. I'll let the series do the talking. Overall for me it's astonishing.

I hope the series and season 4 especially makes you feel like running up that hill."
"I've seen all the episodes of Daredevil, House of Cards, Master of None, Narcos, and several other of Netflix's brilliant shows. This is definitely the best one to date. It's scary from time to time, but it's still scarier than 99% of horror movies that come out in theaters these days. All of the actors--including the young kid actors and the adult actors--are brilliant and give outstanding performances. Literally each one of them could be nominated for an Emmy. The fact that they're all unknown actors (save for Winona Ryder) adds to the mysteriousness of the show, and their chemistry and dialogue is spot-on. There's nothing predictable about Stranger Things--each episode had something happen that I never would've predicted. Most shows have moments where you can pretty much guess what's going to happen at certain parts, but NEVER in this show. Once I started the first episode, I ended up binge- watching the rest of the season in one weekend, which is the shortest period of time it ever took me to watch a single show. Really looking forward to season 2!"
"Just finished Season 3 and not gonna lie...I didn't love it. The innocence and youth is what made this show so great the first season. It can't be topped. Maya Hawke had no business being in this. She's not talented enough to cover for being unattractive and she's not attractive enough to cover for having no talent. Big misstep. When they gotta throw in LGBTQ+...well it's not natural to the storyline so it feels forced and pandering and then you know they just lost the plot. They are going back in time but adding today's issues just so they can cover all the bases but it takes you out of the storyline and all you do is say ""Oh yep! That's the director checking off that box."" And killing Hopper?! I mean I guess he could still be alive but geez! What a downer. And where the hell is Joyce moving to? Did she magically find another job that requires no brains or skill that would actually pay enough to enable her to afford a move? And why does the oldest son have to go with them? He could stay in town to be with Nancy. And who would buy their dump of a house anyway? Why did they make this season about Billy? I didn't care about him last season so I didn't care that he died in this season. Sadie Sink...bug eyes are all I see when she's onscreen. Why are they trying to make her happen? She's no looker yet she's doing modeling campaigns now. Caleb McLaughlin? We've given him 3 seasons now and it's official...he CANNOT act. I thought Paul Reiser died last season? Carey Elwes found Botox. Ugh! And c'mon I knew we'd see Dustin's girlfriend at some point BUT singing an entire song while people are dying that could've been saved if they hadn't done that?! Dumb and cringeworthy.

So what's good? Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Natalie Dyer (killing me with her handling of all the guns!), Brett Gelman (hated him last season but this one he was funny). I'd like to add Joe Keery because he was fantastic last season but this season?! He acted like a completely different character from the first two seasons so I kept thinking ""What is going on? What happened to Steve?!"" I will give them credit for all the 80's references as they were spot on and really took me back to those years.

Wish Sean Austin wouldn't have been killed off. He was great last season and would've elevated the show this season.

Such huge buildup for this season. Waited a long time and then we get what we got...left me feeling like ""Meh"" and wishing it would've ended after the first season so it could remain perfectly preserved as truly great in my mind. It kills me that such a great show went off the rails after season 1 and now they're just floundering. So disappointing. Everything we see after this is just gonna be reactionary which just kills it for me. They can't top the first season so now they're just gonna focus on being over the top. Duffer Brothers...please just don't."
"Review of Season One:

STRANGER THINGS is a much-vaunted TV series made as a throwback tribute to 1980s cinema of old and mixing together the horror, science fiction, fantasy, and adventure genres. Imagine THE GOONIES mixed with FIRESTARTER and with a little bit of H. P. Lovecraft thrown in and you'll be close. As a huge fan of the 1980s and 1980s cinema as well (it was my decade of my childhood, after all), I was eager to watch this. I was left feeling mildly disappointed. This isn't a bad series, not by a long shot, and it's quite entertaining to watch. The cast are varied and give a series of good performances and there's enough incident and mystery in every episode to keep you watching. However, I was surprised at how derivative and unsurprising it all feels. The plot plays out in the most predictable way imaginable, with obvious heroes and villains, bits of THE BLOB and the like added to the mix, and a strong sense of familiarity hanging over the proceedings. There's a heavy emphasis on low rent CGI whereas I thought practical effects would have fitted the series better. Nothing that happens will surprise you, and some sub-plots feel more than a little dragged out. Still, I've watched the trailer for season two and it looks bigger and better, so I'll be coming back to check it out.

Review of Season Two:

Season 2 of the show follows on much as the first, albeit without the sense of freshness. Once again we get mired in a plot of likeable kids, shady adults, weird CGI creatures and plenty of action and adventure mixed into the running time. Some of the best things about this season are the songs (as cool as ever) and the appearance of '80s actors like Sean Astin and Paul Reiser. I did think at times, however, that this was a bit half-hearted, made up of left-over bits that they didn't manage to fit into the first season; come the end we really haven't progressed very far from what came before.

Review of Season Three:

The good news is that Season 3 is the best yet and a real step up on what's come previously. The story is as cliched as ever, but there's more incident this time around, more drama and a heck of a lot more suspense. Billy's character becomes one of the most interesting in the show while the new characters proceed to wow and touch the audience as much as the originals. The CGI effects are better and the series has a real momentum which builds to some massively impressive set-pieces. I could have done without the sickly sentimentality of the last 20 minutes of the final episode, but the rest is generally very good.

Review of Season Four:

Sadly, this latest season is by far the worst yet and it's all because of the length. We get ridiculously long episodes from the get go and they're long because of repetitive plotting and endless padding. The threat seems more minor than last season and there's too much comic relief from stupid characters, like Thurman's daughter and the annoying stoner guy. Eddie is head and shoulders above everyone else here but he's criminally underused by the writers. There is some good action laced in, but it's outweighed by incessant pairing-off exposition, foot dragging and syrupy sentimentalism."
"I loved the series so much, I watched all season in less than a week. It makes you anxious, it makes you laugh, all in all I'd say it has the right amount of everything. The casting is one of the best I've seen lately with ""El"" and ""Dustin"" being on top of my list.

On the cons I'd say it's Robin's endless blubbering. At some point I was tired of listening to her voice even she said just ""OK"" . She speaks A LOT and, apart from discovering that music will save victims from Vecna's attacks, her contribution is a huge nothing. It's almost as if this character was created in favor of nepotism. The story would evolve exactly the same without her."
"Again a good season from Stranger things . First I was bit afraid due to Season 4 episodes where 1hr+ runtime each , I thought this time they gonna disappoint , but they totally surprised me . Not even a single scene felt unwanted or wasted . Actually story takes place in many places ( multi layerd ) so of course that's the main reason for long runtime for each episode . Each and every layer of story was engaging and kept us hooked up throughout the season . This time series had more horror elements and more disturbing scenes comparing to it's previous seasons . Asusual each and every characters where impressive , even some new characters were good . Cast wise all gave their best . Eventhough series had some flaws like some plotholes and illogical scenes the way story moves we fail to notice it . VFX wasn't completely convincing , but okay . Cinematography was good . Editing was well done , multi layered story was well cut and edited . Overall again a thrilling , engaging and entertaining season from Stranger things series . Definitely worth the wait .

Waiting for Vol 2 ( last 2 episodes ) releasing on Jul 27 ."
The first 2 seasons are really good but the third one is really disappointing
"I grew up watching eighties' stuff like Goonies, Gremlins, E.T. and all of that stuff, and of course wonderful horror like Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street the Thing and Jaws, and this series struck that nerve like a jackhammer. From the bikes, to the Dungeons and Dragons, the hair and basically everything. This show is basically a love letter to the spielbergian action movies for kids, and unlike other similar attempts, like Turbo Kid, it's not a parody.

Also: great acting (especially the kids), superb casting, wonderful set design and dramaturgy. Easy 10/10 for me on this one, and praying for a season two. Rarely have I been able to watch seven episodes without a single break. More stuff like this Netflix."
"I wasn't sure about this series at first, but I heard such great stuff about the series from my brother, so I decided to give the series a watch. And wow I was amazed how the series keeps you glued on happens next.

Set in 1983, and it feels like it was made in that decade, the filmmakers even use an 80's like soundtrack. The story is quite an awesome mystery each episode is like puzzle you slowly put together. An awesome blend of horror and sci-fi. The actors all play there parts really well, David Harbour is great has the sheriff, times he comes across like a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off. Winona Ryder is great has a mother, don't care what other people say about her performance, I thought she really delivered. And the other young actors are awesome here, they all just keep you watching. And now I'm waiting for season 2."
"The series is incredibly long but each episode has a detail that contributes so much to you wanting to click on ""next episode"" which is amazing, I would give it 10/10 if it wasn't for season 4, it was a little unnecessary, but still added a lot more to Jane/Eleven's backstory.

The character development, the 80s theme and the monsters give the series an incredible way and make every hour spent in my life worth it.

In my opinion it is a series that I would recommend to watch with friends Friday with popcorn because marathoning this series takes time, because patience is what you need to wait for new episodes."
"I don't understand how some people don't like it. The fact that some people said ""Too long wait for season 4"" and gave 1 star like did y'all forget about covid pandemic? That was the reason we had to wait so long. But sure it may be not for everyone and is more for like teens but mostly everything in the show was really good. The acting, the cast, story. I just loved everything in stranger things and I'll never change my mind."
"This show is very bad horror, it's never ever scary, it's like the Disney version of a scary show. The main psychic girl is very annoying and just unconvincingly screams alot with her hand up at plot hole filled monsters that are just homages to other things. The first seasons monster is just inter dimensional jaws, and the second seasons is just big cloud/shadow of a xenomorph. Nothing is original, most of the characters are annoying and the plot is just a side thought to countless 80s ""easter eggs"" and ""homages"" which translates to no original idea in here whatsoever"
"Never fancied this, not at all. But oh my god how good is this show?! It's tense, exciting but also has some really lovely and tender moments. By god though my nerves are totally shot at with the suspense. Excellent story that just keeps giving. Every season gets better and better. Great acting, great story. It's got cheeky kids, scary bits, monsters, 80s music and the supernatural- what more can you ask for."
"S4 makes more sense now, not completely finished but the PTSD themes are evident.

Modern classics in horror coming to light too.

Enjoy it, hope s4 will deliver final episodes."
Best show EVER!!! Do I need to really say anymore other then HURRY UP :)
"Horror, comedy, adventure, action, suspense this show had everything in it and everything works.

This is hands down one of the best villain in stranger things universe and i luv the twist and name vecna.

One of the biggest thing i want to mention here is i can watch this show with my whole family. That's really rare these days.

My only problem is with Netflix. They should have released all episodes at once. I subscribed to Netflix three years back only because i don't have to wait for each episode to release in a week. A whole season gets dropped and i can binge watch it in one night and discuss with my frnds in the morning. I wish we had that back."
"I feel comfortable saying that this is the best show I've seen this year. I'll be honest with you, yes I like many things from the eightees and I noticed some of the styles I keep seeing in my grandma's photo albums. I like the eightees style and all the colorful clothing. Mostly today I keep noticing either bleak colors or some pieces of clothing have like only black/grey and one color. Some of my favorite music is from the eightees too. I didn't live in the eightees but they seemed like an amazing time. I indeed do like this show because of this reason too.

The writing seems to be really good most of the time and for the first three seasons they didn't do much horror clichés but the fourth season had too many horror movie clichés. Murderer killing teenagers, they forgot how to run or stomp at the vines growing towards them, ""Let's suddenly split up instead of going in pairs like we did just moments ago."" That last one had me like ""Wtf? What the..."" If Vecna knew the group were coming up the stairs and is as powerful as he is why didn't he just redirect the molotovs like really easily? Don't say it's because he wasn't in someone's mind. It wasn't that. It took him minutes to murder the whole freaking lab in an episode. Now he can't handle two molotovs. At a point the characters also became dumb as duck. They came in through Watergate which was at a murder site. Dustin had to basically spell it out for them. The woman who was called Nancy Drew and investigated whole lot in season three forgot that 1+1=2. The sudden drop in Nancy's IQ between seasons. Seriously.

The plot itself is great but somehow Vecna felt like a Deus ex machina. How's he controlling the Upside-down and not vise versa? Because he's smart? Because he's the main bad guy who had some magical powers he got from being different? The Mindflayer possessed Will. Did it possess Will because it was Vecna? Where was Vecna during the other seasons? Where was the murder house? Fourth season felt like a Slasher flick. They even mentioned Slasher flicks and the kids still did Slasher flick mistakes. This turned out to be a season 4 review."
"I'll try to be short and direct without getting into too much details . I had rated this show a 9 before as something was missing for me , for it to be a 10 . Finished part 2 of S4 last night and I've just changed it to a 10 . The scenes with Max in part 1 and Eddie guitar solo in part 2 were unforgettable , or even Hopper swinging that sword .

Also Joseph Quinn performance was outstanding . Writing was phenomenal during all seasons , but it peaked in S4 so far . The development and evolution of some the characters like Lucas and Steve from a really bad person to something like a big brother or father figure and protector . The love triangle between Steve , Eddie and Dustin The emotional roller coaster this season - Simply wow - Those brothers know which buttons to push .

Kate Bush have also entered my playlist."
....but just wanted to say thank god for keeping Brett Gelman in the cast. He's brilliant and so funny. Even through the emotional bits he's there for comic relief and he really nails it.
"Putting the 80s nostalgia aside, I thought this show would be pretty bad, with annoying references to trends at that time or whatever Surprisingly, I completely agree with this being Netflix's trademark show even if I don't think it's their best show ( bojack horseman still exists) The duffer brothers manage to inject their own sense of style into this show whilst still containing a well developed plot with some really likeable characters This show is flawed, don't get me wrong, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. Highly recommend it, especially because it's easily accessible on Netflix, and lets face everyone is using or owns an account"
"An extremely well written story of a group of young friends whose selfless altruism out thinks adults and lets their brilliance save the day. We spent our entire Saturday binge watching from beginning to end. The acting was masterful and the plot was unique. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was the regular, unwelcome diversions from the core story...why do writers think we like the tired device of the local adolescent sociopaths who harass the heroes? I could not grasp why the bullying scenes were necessary, because the core story had more than enough power to carry the series all the way through. Each relevant character evoked either our sympathy for their triumphs, or satisfaction when they earned justice. We cared about what happened to them - good writing."
"I don't understand why they decided to go for a complete tonal shift in season 3, when compared to 1 & 2. Season 3 went with a full on horror/comedy route leaving behind the heart and character development that was so prevalent in seasons 1 & 2. And don't get me started on those painfully embarrassing product placements. Weirdly after season 3 , for once in my life I'm not looking forward to season 4. Something tells me they've lost the magic touch completely. It's going to go down the Micheal Bay route from now on, more explosions and more monsters. I'd like to remember Stranger Things for seaonss 1 & 2, for me Season 3 never happened."
"This is easily one of the best series on Netflix with a clear plot and arc throughout all three seasons. Stranger Things has really loveable characters throughout the whole series who all grow and learn and the acting is really good it's Oscars worthy especially from Milly Bobby Brown who plays Eleven. Direction is really good from the Duffer Brothers.

If you love the 80's you'll love this series even more with loads of refrences to movies and music from the 80's. Only negative is couple of the episodes feel out of place apart from that every episode is thrilling and exciting there is always something going on in the Hawkins town."
"This is my favourite television show and a good sci fi/horror combo.

The way the show plays out, how individual characters find out the same thing individually through the show.

Superb!??"
The most important reason for the success of this work is the spirit of The Duffer Brothers. You can notice the passion and the power of writing during the watching and all you have to do is clap your hands for this great effort. Four seasons without mistake and wish for more seasons to be coming as soon as possible.
"The show started off strong, sort of like The Goonies meets the X-Files set in the 80s for pure nostalgic reasons. The first season deserves 10 out of 10 stars, the first season was great.

The second season wasn't that bad either, but it started to slip a little.

Some Season Three we have a clear cut example of how to destroy a series.

They had a formula that worked, they had a formula that was fantastic and people really loved it.

And then they left the formula behind and started to turn out stories based on politics and the same outrage culture that tanked so many other shows, comics, franchises, and stories.

Characters did abrupt changes to better fit into the political bubble that we are seeing again and again. Good guys became scum bags because of race and gender, the focus characters changed.

And what you are left with is a dumpster fire that best describes how to destroy a great show.

Update:

So Stranger Things took another hard pivot and dropped all the unnecessary woke political nonsense and started making the show entertaining again.

It was actually able to redeem itself and get good again.

So I'm changing my review to 10 stars again, because it's not the same crap that is on every other channel any more."
"Wow, I mean this is crazy, I stumbled upon the third season and are you freaking kidding me, this is probably the best television show that I've ever watched in my life time. The actors, all of them are outstanding, from start to finish every episodes are incredibly well written and the direction is right up there with the best, it's funny, scary, romantic, sexy, mysterious, intriguing, filled with surprises, it's action packed, the sfx and cgi is excellent and the storyline never gets boring. I can't wait to watch the first and second season especially with Winona Ryder alone I'm sold but of course without the rest of the cast like David Harbour and young Elizabeth Perkins lookalike Millie Bobby Brown, Natalia Dyer, Dacre Montgomery are incredibly talented, oh and almost forgot the music, throughout the show they always come up with from the 80s greatest hits, what a treat and the synthesizer they use during suspense scenes. The show is the best out there hands down period. I hope this show will go on for a long time. Good watch"
"The first season 1 is perfect. Great story, good acting and i love the 80's atmosphere. Season 2 is still good but season 3 is really garbage. The actors became annoying (a lot of arguing and stupid conversationele) and it became really childish."
"Pretty good series overrall, the core theme was done well and the sets, acting and plot were great for all seasons, i personally thought that some seasons did go on for a little too long though especially the last episode in season 4 but either than that it was a pretty good show."
"I just finished season 4 & after reading a few of the top comments, Im truly surprised at the negativity.

I thought it was a great season -although I did hate the fact that Eddy was killed! He was such a misunderstood character & those are the ones I love best! Now, if you wanna start comparing seasons & what ""coulda/shoulda/woulda been better, if only""... you will most assuredly find disappointment. You simply cannot please everyone & that's okay. I very much enjoyed season 4!"
No cap but this tv series is very great one of my favorite tv series season 1 is great season 2 is good but season 3 is legendary and season 4 was better. Can't wait to see season 5.
"Thank you for this show.

Thank you for the amazing characters.

Thank you for the casting.

Thank you for the story.

Thank you for the music choices.

What a show.

What a journey.

What an escape."
"I love this show so, so much. It's got a perfectly balanced tone and I've been hooked since season 1. You can't help but binge it. I can't even describe the fondness I feel for this show and its cast and characters. Keep in mind that I think this show is very close to perfect; it's one of my very favourites. But there are flaws, and if I speak more on flaws than strengths it's because it's easier to critique something that try and explain what makes it so amazing.

I would call season 1 pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. It might not bring anything groundbreaking to the table from a storytelling perspective, but that doesn't prevent it being a masterpiece. It's impossible not to fall in love with all these characters, who all have real depth and feel like real people, of course helped by the amazing chemistry and cast (even the child actors are doing a terrific job here). Even characters like Steve, originally drawn as a typical jock bully, have space to grow and shine in this show. Season 1's storyline is gripping the entire way through. The demogorgon is genuinely terrifying and it's so gripping to watch the characters stumble and shine through the struggles. The show managed to capture a mood and sense of awe and magic that is truly unique and beautiful.

The second season is in my opinion the most forgettable so far, but by no means the worst. I think the quality is very consistent (much more so that season 3 and 4, if not reaching the same highs), except that Lost Sister episode which was boring, felt completely out of place, and whose storyline was thankfully dropped. I think the magic of season 1 is lost in the following seasons, which isn't to say they aren't amazing; they just don't feel quite as special. Season 2 might be the least standout for me, but I think it has less flaws that 3 and 4 and it still tells an amazing story with amazing characters. It upped the anti from season 2 in a natural way that I think worked really well. It introduced important and fun concepts like the Mind Flayer, and characters that matched those of season 1 like Max, Billy and Bob (whose death was heartbreaking; this season is emotionally charged and I love it). It also gave us Dustin and Steve, the BEST combo.

The third season I think is where flaws start to crop up more often. That's not to say I don't love it, because I really do. I think the root of the flaws come from the continuously widening scope. But I would still give this season an 8/10 because I still love it. It continues to branch on this amazing gripping story and shows us the characters we've fallen in love with. Again it perfectly balances tone, with lots of cute moments, drama and horror, and genuine emotion. Dustin and Steve shine as usual, as does the new Robin. Billy's sacrifice is gut wrenching and beautiful. Hopper's 'death' was not pulled off convincingly, but his letter to El was still amazing. I loved Alexei and his death was heartbreaking. Will's breakdown was very compelling. However, while I love this season there are some things I do not like. First of all, Erica... the actress is doing a great job but in my opinion Erica was just straight up annoying the entire season and really REALLY dragged down the trio of Dustin, Steve and Robin. Her inclusion in such a major role bothered me a lot and really staled that part of the season. Hopper's character also takes a hit this season for me. He is kind of just an asshole to everyone for not much reason, and he does sort of learn past this but I just feel he loses a lot of his compassion from the previous seasons, mostly taking the action hero role. The characters are still the best part of the show but there are getting to be too many of them, and some are being dragged down. The widening scope also leads to some silliness and a lapse in the realism and tone of the first two seasons. The kids are invincible now apparently, breaking into a top secret Russian base and defeating an enormous body snatcher mind flaying monster. Yes, one of our characters has super powers but the rest are just ordinary kids or adults and they're starting to become a little too powerful. Some stakes are being lost. Season 3 is also where the show stops being scary in my opinion. We might fear for our characters, but CGI flesh monsters are not scary. It might be more violent and darker in 3 and 4, but the actual horror is gone for me. But yes, I do love this season so so much. I still love this show so so much. Overall it's still an amazing show.

Season 4 is amazing. It is really and truly leading up to an amazing conclusion for the series, and I think it's above seasons 2 and 3 for me. There are more flaws than those first two seasons but it reaches amazing heights and I LOVE it. Vecna is an amazing new villain (and that storyline and plot twist with 001 was perfectly executed, thrilling and entertaining). The characters are again amazing, the storyline thoroughly gripping. I love the new characters and plot. The raw brutality of this season is gripping, and seeing the demogorgon again got me and my girlfriend cheering. I love how it's all being pieced together, all building to a spectacular conclusion. I do still have gripes, but overall I think season 4 is proving to be near perfect. My biggest issue is again the scope: characters are shunned, the realism is being lost, and things are definitely overblown in places. For example, Joyce and Murray's escape in the plane is comical. The California gang are MAJORLY shunned and do almost nothing all season once El is taken (has Mike done really anything meaningful since s1??). El's classmates are completely over the top caricatures. The demogorgon is suddenly beaten by a stick with a little fire? These things do add up, but overall I am loving this season so much.

The show is just a masterpiece, and while I think it does have flaws (especially in later seasons) it's still near-perfect and is building to a thrilling conclusion."
"I have enjoyed all 3 seasons of this show. I'm not sure why all that hate for season 3 because personally, I liked it the best. Had lots of 80's throwback items like the cars, movies at the movie theater and the music and clothing. Mixture of fright, adventure, action and comedy relief characters. It was a fresh relief to the first two seasons. I really like the first two as well but I was glad they added some of the funny awkwardness of boys starting to like girls and going into that preteen weirdness of life and not just trying to make it all about a dark monster show."
This show is amazingly good awesome characters and lots of action. But for real WHERE IS THE NEW SEASON ITS BEEN 3 years lol.
"And to 80's movies in particular. Having lived through the 80's I admit I am extremely nostalgic about this decade, but this is a well-made series non the less. The attention to detail is really refreshing, some of which you may not get if you weren't alive at that time. The characters, themes and settings all seem familiar because the creators have drawn from a wealth of 80's entertainment for inspiration.

I prefer movies from this decade because of nostalgia but also because this was a much happier time in this country. Everyone was hopeful and optimistic about the future. The average person today seems to dread what's in store for us. Oddly enough we are actually living in a world that many 80's movies predicted.

The creators of this series were genius having this occur during that decade. Ignore the negative reviews, they are idiots, the actors, special effects, dialogue and story are all great. The music is also wonderful and really helps to create the mood. If you want to escape to a better time and be entertained, watch this show."
"Very pleasant surprise. Netflix and Duffer bros pretty much nailed it.

An elaborate and hard working homage to John Carpenter, Spielberg, Raimi, Stephen King and other horror-adventure masters of the 70's and 80's that also stands on it's own legs.

While Stranger Things does lack sometimes finely timed emotional punch and doesn't go full escalation in some cases, it still blinds with quality. From atmosphere to music, nice story, good characters and damn fine actors, this Netflix show is a great viewing.

I'm not going to spoil anything, story is interesting and if show's synopsis here is not enough for you, then you'll just have to check the show for yourself. It does play with some sci-fi/horror standards, sometimes diving in completely, sometimes defying them but almost always is treating it's story and legacy with respect.

Yes, it is a bit of nostalgia-bate but it uses that as an advantage and not cheap gimmick, which I find important to make it more distinct from other projects that solely bank on cheap nostalgic tricks.

I'm totally recommending it and hoping that we'll get Season 2 or something similar."
"Let me start by saying I loved seasons 1 and 2, Giving both 9 out of10. Season 3 it dropped to 7 out of10. Now I'm 5 episodes into season4, and I've given up on it. It is poorly written...I loath the fact that most of the characters simply don't talk to each/tell each other what is happening. The story just seems like an excuse to carry on a popular show, while turning it into a horror show. Most of the shows characters have now become nothing more than annoying."
"I had HIGH hopes for this show. My mistake. Do you like plot holes, horrific acting (Winona Ryder), nonstop yelling for no reason (Winona Ryder), and unintelligible writing (the entire show), then this is the show for you. Since it seems America loves stupidity, this show is a major hit."
"Watched the new first 7 episodes of series 4. Wow, especially the episode Dear Billy, the gunfight scene and Max's scene at the graveyard are gripping and so well made. The sound track is spot on. Can't wait until July 1st."
"Season 1 was pretty damn great, unpredictable, interesting, great characters, awesome music. It was for the most part greatly written, acted and directed. Season 2 however, isn't as good. It was predictable, strangely boring at times and didn't innovate enough from the first season.

It's like they got surprised by the success of the first season and suddenly was in a hurry to make season 2. That is what it feels like. And that's too bad, because this show was the biggest surprise in a long time. And it needs to deliver this sort of storytelling and originality in it's third season or it will be one of those TV shows that had a great first season, and then everything went downhill from there. Like ""Lost"" and ""Prison Break"" to just mention two out of maaaaany.

Anyways, season 2 wasn't bad, but not really good either, it had it's moments for sure, but not as good as season 1. Season 2 starts off very well, but it's after episode 4 that it all falls apart and becomes incredibly predictable, sentimental and boring.

I will change my score of this show for every season, as everyone should. As we are not voting on the pilot episode here, but the series as a whole, and that impression changes as episodes are releases.

First season was a 9/10 for me. With season 2 the series currently stands at a 7/10. And i am only hoping for it to rise again, i want another great season like the first, i don't want a new prison break."
As the title says you cant go wrong with stranger tings. A huge traffic builder for Netflix and rightly so
"As many other reviewers here have already noted, Things have gotten worse with each successive season. What started as something fresh yet familiar, has just become a re-tread each season revisiting the ageing actors and following their character arcs -- except the characters just don't seem all that engaging anymore either.

Season 3 introduced the daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke as a gay character, because.....it was somehow essential to the story that she be gay. Probably the same reason gratuitous nudity and sex scenes were somehow essential throughout 'Game of Thrones'.

Season 4 seems determined to recreate some 'Carrie' vibes further cementing the homage to Stephen King. However, the least appealing storyline is the Russian gulag and watching Winona Ryder relentlessly overact. To be fair, Winona has been overacting since season one, but the better story helped distract from it back then.

Winona is not the only distracting actor in this show. Some of the kids seem to have become anorexic the older they have gotten. It is truly disturbing watching young people who look like they have actually spent time in a gulag, especially since they weren't involved in that story line.

Look, if you are just wanting to dip your toes back into the Stranger Things world every year or two, then each new season will not disappoint you. However, if you really enjoyed the first season and want to cherish your good memories of that...then this show has truly worn out its welcome."
Can't wait for second volume. It such a worth waiting season. The visuals really improved. The storyline is very solid and more dark than previous seasons. Love the horror elements. Like the twist at the end of volume 1. Every character is likeable.
"Ok, truth be known I am almost 70, had four boys who grew up in the 80s and I just loved the first 3 seasons, when kids couldn't just text are you home? But had to get on the bike and ride to their friends house. The clothes, the video shop, the landlines all looked perfect. The cast in Season 4 have grown n changed as we all do when young. I also confess I was a bit scared of Vecna and wasn't sure if I would continue. But I did and what a reward. The episode with Max and the Running up the Hill, a wonderful 80's song was stunning and so suspenseful. Same with Eddie's awesome rendition of Master of Puppets, I've laughed, I've squirmed, I've worried and I've cried with this wonderful bunch of kids and Joyce and Hopper too. Awesome TV, cant recommend enough."
"I liked this show, but the third season is a completely disaster, it's really boring, stupid, full of stupid and useless scene and I also found the acting worse. Let's hope in a better fourth season..."
"Seasons 1 to 3 were very cute and fun, but season four had a very sad atmosphere, but the story was stronger.

They could also end the series in the fourth season and kill ""one"", but they wanted to make the series longer.

And about the actors, I must say that I really liked the character of ""Dustin"" and Mr. David Harbor's performance was also very good.

The actors also suddenly grew up in the fourth season and no longer had that cute childlike atmosphere.

"What a series it's has been and I will be sad to see it come to an end... Netflix will struggle to top it!!!

Not enough feel good/horror series out there!"
"Season 1,2= great. Season 3 = a complete joke So childish and illogical"
"But that's only one reason why I think this storytelling has worked. The cultural mash up gives something for parents to reminisce. But you also get to see your children gasp and grip in suspense, for the second time, in the very plot points and twists that you had enjoyed back then. The storytelling is done so masterfully that there's no sense of it all being a rip-off.

It's intense viewing at times, and I found myself chuckle at myself about all that. There's some emotional stuff too for old romantics like me. We we're young once. You're allowed to be drawn in and invested in every relationship. You get to care about them, and there's nothing that leaves you wondering about what should or shouldn't have happened. That's satisfying viewing.

The actors shine again in Season 2 and that's the polish on this production.

Somehow I think the creators have managed to leave a cultural legacy for Gen X parents, so I tip my hat to them for that. My 13 and 12 year old we're not disappointed, and that counts for a lot of legacy if you think about it. Well done indeed."
"Seriously I like stranger things but I'm not a hardcore fan. But after watching the volume 1 of season 4, specifically the last episode, now I'm insanely waiting for the volume 2 of season 4. The last episode of the volume 2 of season 4 explains the whole stranger things scenario. Watch it if you didn't watch yet. Eagerly waiting for the ending."
"I am not going to spoil anything but you need to watch this.

The acting and 80's magic perfectly sets the mood, seasons 3 and 4 are very memorable and different, but in a good way."
"I've enjoyed stranger things from seasons 1 through 4. In season 4, they took a lot of ideas from the Nightmare on Elm Street movies and made them their own. Still held its own. Overall great season. I wish we could have gotten 12-15 episodes."
"This series has everything a really good series should. Great cast chemistry, story line, script, cinematography, special effects, soundtrack, etc. Plus the added bonuses of the importance of family and friends, good triumphs over evil, love, loss, it shows growing up is an awkward time for everyone and bullies get their comeuppance. The list goes on and on. I can't say enough good things about it. A resounding win for Netflix."
"Thank you Netflix! Stranger Things to me is a masterpiece in so many ways. The directing, the acting, the setting, the feeling is spot on. All acting is above par with a roller-coaster of emotions mixed with drama, suspense, comedy and the overall mixture of the characters works well. Bringing the audience back to the 80's is an understatement, they do it perfect and it feels good. The ET/Goonies/X-Files environment this show carries to the audience is a total win. It makes me feel very special to watch a show of this high caliber. Oh yeah.. Excellent soundtrack for sure! 10 out of 10 and it deserves much more!

I very much hope more seasons will be released, as I assume there will be. It is going to be very hard patiently waiting for more."
"After watching season 4 volume 1

I have to rethink again about the top one TV show

Stranger things definitely one of the best shows on all tv history

Lots of stories different actions happening in different places but all are amusing and perfectly made like masterpiece

Cannot wait to watch part two."
"I didn't even like season 1 that much. E.T. meets Alien, but the story doesn't make sense."
Netflix knocked the show out of the park. 11 is a badass. It's just a over all good show.
"Love the show a whole lot, everything about it: the style, the drama, the horror, the comedy and most importantly the characters. Hats off to the writers and actors as the way different characters are paired with each other to shake up the dynamics in ways you couldn't imagine.

The most remarkable thing however is that all these kids can act and have continually proven this each season. They are getting better with age rather than worse which I think is very uncommon for child stars."
"The most genuinely scary season since season 1, while still being funny like season 3. Season 4 is everything great about Stranger Things. Could go down as one of the best shows of all time."
"After a phenomenal first season, I feel Stranger Things has completely lost its edge; recycling the same ideas we've seen on TV a million times before. First, I thought this season was a complete recycle of an episode of Fringe I saw a couple of years back, called: Alone in the World; Fringe was an American science fiction television series that ran from 2008-2013. In this episode, the Fringe team discover a large fungal network in a service tunnel which is actually part of a superorganism that functioned like the Shadow Monster. The infection also psychically connects to a young boy (named Aaron), who discovered the phenomenon, and if the Fringe team try to kill the organism, Aaron dies too. The Fringe team also finds that the organism is growing rapidly; creating its own ecosystem with tentacles and death spores for defence. Sound familiar? Google it. Furthermore, Joyce, Johnathan and Nancy make Will's body inhabitable to the Shadow Monster by increasing the temperature, because the monster likes the cold, which is identical to something I saw a season or two ago in Supernatural, in an episode called: The Things They Carried. Even, Elevens adventures this season could have been taken straight out of the pages of the Firestarter miniseries; based on Charlie McGee, a young girl with psychokinetic powers. I am sure Eleven is based on the character Charlie McGee, however, at least try to bring us an original story.

To spite a weak second season, I'll still be watching the third. Hopefully, the writers can get us back on track and bring us something we haven't seen before on either X-Files or Fringe. Otherwise, I'll be checking out for the fourth. It's a real shame too, the second season of Stranger Things had such huge potential but they went in completely the wrong direction.

Season 1: 9/10. Season 2: 4.5/10."
"Season 1 deserved all the hype. Amazing.

Season 2 was ok.

Season 3: don't bother"
"Ive always loved stranger things, but I have been noticing that for each season the series gets someway worse. Season 1-2 are great. Season 3 is ok. But the new season 4 is disappointing. I mean, what in the world happened to the acting. Millie bobby brown does it good, and some else, but in all, wtf. An example of this terrible acting is when El gets bullied. Wth was that. And as far as we can watch right now, the story is crazy fast. You cannot compare season 4 to 1-2. I dont get the same comfo feeling from the show. Its too fashion, clearly!"
I loved the season 4. It lived up to the hype and it was really good specially ep 4 and 7. I loved all the new characters and the acting is amazing. Idk why some people say its not good but the actors did their job very well. This is kinda dark and fun to watch. I cant wait for v2 after watching ep 7. Like literally i loved ep 7 so much the ending was amazing and s4 v1 delivered. Now cant wait for v2 to see what we have in the super long 2 h 30 mins long finale. Im really hoping any of our beloved character doesnt die. Therefore loved it. Cant wait!!!!
"I love the first season. The story isn't very original, mixing the story of Akira (1988) with the Goonies, but it works well, with a good balance between 80s nostalgia, science fiction and horror.

The second season is pretty messy, with more forced ""diversity"" shoved down your throat and a story that just tries to repeat the first season, without the mystery that made the first season intriguing.

The third season is the worst in my opinion, being very cringy from the first episode, with all the characters acting like a bad sitcom, trying to make flat jokes that ruin the ambience. Following the feminist approach pushed by most Netflix shows once they are renewed, all the male characters are portrayed as goofy and stupid, while the intelligent girls save the day.

And of course you wouldn't have a TV show in 2019 without.... EVIL RUSSIANS! Showing that the goal is clearly to produce propaganda rather than to entertain.

Watch the first season, and pretend that it wasn't renewed."
"I absolutely adore the progression of this series. It had never ever felt abruptly slow or confusingly fast, everything felt natural. The same can be said as to how the sub-plot weaves together especially at the end of every season where the main character's struggles and conflicts seemingly became connected together and the results of it just feels so satisfying. Besides that, there were a lot of image-worthy shots, and, especially in season 4, the transitions were oh so freaking smooth.

I gave it an 8 star though because of the mess of season 3. The other seasons were amazing except the oddly chosen conflict for that particular season."
"Season 1 is a masterpiece - a mix of Spielberg, King, the music from the 80s, funny kids in a small town in the middle of nowehere. Everything is good in season 1. Season 2 is OK, a little bit far-fetched, but sticks with the original concept. Season 3 however is horrible, just horrible - it is not even that the writers simply have no idea what to do with this concept, but it is freaking ugly - loud, colourful, annoying. Season 3 is like every good movie taken by the Hollywood and destroyed to the core- all what was subtle is changed into colourful screaming ugliness. I would rate it 10/10 for season 1, 8 for season 2 and 4-5 for season 3, sorry."
"Its a great show so far, currently I am on season one episode five, and im loving it !! love the old time feeling ! the kids are great actors and great characters ! its not too ""scary"" but still manages to be ""adult enough to watch while i think a young teenager could enjoy it just the same... and a bonus the blu rey/dvd at Target for seasons 1,2 looks like a VHS tape !! i hope Target keeps that up for as long as the show runs !"
"This is the best season of the best show ever!!!

PERIOD!!!!

Perfect cast. Amazing story. I only wish they played more 80's music to set the tone for the time period."
"As expected, true to his '80s nostalgia nature, the second season of ""Stranger Things"" takes the sequel path - and it does so in the best possible way: it's definitely in the alley of ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Aliens"" rather than the trite ""more of the same"" approach.

The story builds on the previous installment as we find the characters where we left them at the end of the last season. The attention to details, the '80s feeling, the references - that were the trademark of season 1 - are all still there while the character driven narrative moves forward.

The idea of splitting the main characters is a risk that pays off, giving each character room to breath and to grow on their own. The newbies also work, although a couple of them aren't as focused as they could've been.

The story is cohesive and well told, a little darker in places and a little more action-y at times (but not to the point of becoming pointless or annoying) - and it manages to be perfectly self-contained, while still planting enough seeds for future seasons to grow around.

The usual amount of references and homages (with several new ones throw in the mix) prevent it from be really innovative or deeply creative, but that's not a bad thing, here, and the material is very well executed.

Great cast all around, strong performances - although, someone must've told young Finn Wolfhard that he was one of the best actor from the previous season as he tries to overdo himself, here, sometimes going a bit overboard (and, at times, it feels like he's using his character to audition for a young Kylo Ren in the Star Wars franchise). Nothing major, though, and it doesn't subtract from the enjoyment.

All in all, the numerous 10 stars it's getting are definitely over- rating, but it's a solid, well rounded 8/10 experience."
"Season 1-2 were refreshing and unique with the 80's atmosphere, horror elements, and charismatic characters.

Season 3-4 are almost entirely the same recipe except now it's getting boring having been there done that. The latest season's episodes are very long (1h 15min) and couldn't keep my attention for more than 20-30min each. The Russian storyline was completely detached from the overall plot. The CGI was not the best & the humor this time around felt very forced (especially from Robin). The charm has simply worn off."
"I have to say this show keeps me watching so they must be doing something right.

However can they please stop killing off some of the better characters? Mike, Will, and Robin can all die off please. Mike's just an obnoxious character that serves as 11's simp and Robin/Will are only there to fill the lgbtq quota since they have essentially zero other character development at this point. You killed off Billy, Eddie, and Bob which were all infinitely more interesting characters than Robin/Will/Mike."
"It is a science fiction and cosmic horror completely inspired by the classics of the 70s-80s, but its originality is unique, with a development from a formula that Netflix found and took advantage of very well. That is, the core of groups of characters who develop a mystery separately generating the taste of wanting more each episode, and so in the end their stories collide. The character development also stands out, each one gets the spotlight they deserve, like the example of Steve who in the first season is a bully and in the second season is a cool babysitter! The time soundtrack that is amazing, the action and mystery scenes very well balanced, and a universe that has a lot to develop. A current classic for sure."
"Sometimes it's difficult to find the words to describe what particular elements of a creative endeavor felt disappointing. Other times it's incredibly easy.

The third season of Stranger Things was a depressing mess which exposes the flimsy foundation the series is built upon which includes 80's era nostalgia, pop-culture references and every horror/science fiction trope in existence. The other ingredient is extremely likeable characters who end up being exceptionally watchable in spite of the copy+paste plot that has been provided for them in the third season.

Things in Hawkins, Indiana haven't gotten any stranger over three seasons. We're still dealing with the same villainous entity, the same heroes and marginally different villains. Generic Government cronies have been replaced by Soviet stereotypes. The series is suffering from a crippling case of sequel-itis running its cast through the paces as it moves towards an all-too-inevitable conclusion.

There's part of me that's been feeling this way since the second season, when I quickly realized the show reshuffled the creative deck and played the same cards. The third season has calcified my belief that the show only has lateral moves left to play and updated references to include.

Stranger Things is what happens when you turn Easter eggs into a television series.

The second major issue I had with the third season is very simple: Dramatic irony. For viewers, the plot for entire third season is pretty much revealed in the first episode and a half. The villain, the new host and the entire Russian involvement is all pretty much laid out. The next five episodes are spent catching the characters up with what the audience is already painfully aware of. Joyce (Winona Ryder) is still going on and on about magnets losing their properties when everyone watching knows exactly what is being powered up underneath the Starcourt Mall.

The first season was replete with mystery and tension while building to a satisfying conclusion. The third season is an absolute mess with every major reveal happening so early on that you become impatient waiting for your characters to figure out in episode five what you were well aware of in episode two.

There's also some weird tonal choices. Max (Sadie Sink) learns that her brother is possessed by our evil friend from the Upside Down. In the next scene, she's at a hospital goofing around with her friends like it's no big deal. Simply because the show has to change gears into the pubescent romance plot. How can she worry about her brother when she has to deal with those throbbing hormonal urges? GIGGLE GIGGLE GIGGLE.

The first season of Stranger Things is an excellent bit of homage and escapism. The third season is an absolute mess that feels like a poorly rendered photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy. The further away the Duffer Brothers get from the first season, the flimsier the creative structure feels.

I was hoping the third season of Stranger Things would be a return to form for the series. Instead, it was a brutal disappointment."
"The Stranger Things series was very beautiful, especially in the fourth season. It is true that I was afraid of the fourth season, but it did not disappoint me, and it was much better than I expected. The fourth season made the horror much better, as I felt more fear than any season before, and the mystery and horror was a beautiful thing. The timelines were beautiful and I felt really dangerous in the last two episodes. It was a season worth waiting for, and this series is the best series since the last three years. This series always surprises us in every season. I will say that I am excited for the fifth season."
"Please fund more projects of everyone involved in this. Watching something like this is like receiving a gift. In fact, I am watching this season finale on my birthday. Thank you all for the amazing gift, it sure was a hell of a ride!"
"This sci-fi/horror series stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard,
Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton and Millie Brown. This takes place in Indiana town, Hawkins during the 1980's and centers around single mother, Joyce Byers (Ryder), her son, Jonathan (Heaton), Police Chief, Jim Hopper (Harbour), Young boy, Mike Wheeler (Wolfhard), Mike's sis, Nancy (Dyer) and mysterious, young girl, Eleven (Brown) who has special powers. This is a good, suspenseful series with a decent cast, mainly Ryder and good, atmospheric score that has a Tangerine Dream & John Carpenter feel. 
There's also a Spielberg tone, obviously ""E.T."" and aspects of ""The X-Files,"" 
""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Thing."" If you grew up in the 80's as I did or enjoy sci-fi/horror, I recommend checking this out."
"The suspenseful program you could watch with pre teens in 2016 is long gone in the fourth season. So are the once youthful actors. It's now very dark and gruesome.

And hasn't 11 had enough to deal with already without setting her up against some California mean girls?

I never would have thought all these years later that my favorite character would actually be Steve."
"Great show! Loved the action, and the 80s vibes too!"
"I only manage to finish this series by ""purge watching."" It's my own term. It's the opposite of ""binge watching"" where you're apparently so enraptured by a show you can't stop watching. ""Purge watching"" is when you can't wait for a series to be over, so you use the fast forward button during the throw-away, series-padding scenes. And there's a lot of padding in the show. Like a cheap Stephen King Santa. Honestly, are we supposed to really accept this asa ""homage"" or is it just the ultimate recycling job? A number of critics thought 8 hours devoted to the somewhat thin story of ""Stranger Things"" was excessive. I was thinking about the story in my head, and if it hadn't been given the soap opera drag out treatment, condensed down to a 2-hour movie it would have been even worse -- exposing more clearly the basic silliness and retread plot. The watered-down tempo helped what otherwise would have been Cream of Condensed Tripe. You could claim running the same old numbers is in the name of ""homage"" or you could argue there's really not a lot of new ideas in the show. From the first scene where the scientists get pulled upward into the elevator, dangled by an unseen beast, I went ""ho hum."" Like I haven't see that visual in a million monster films. An old clever show like the X-Files would have had a pair of eyes creepily material in the wall of an elevator and then maybe the doors close and a scream. That show as extremely creative at coming up with original ideas and images -- which is why it was a great show. But immediately I wasn't that impressed with the ""Duffer Brothers"" mise en scene. I need more ""things I've never seen before"" from Sci-fi. And little touches like the elevator scene are where true originals and moderate talents separate themselves. I nearly bailed completely on the series. Episode 3&4 were sluggishly directed by Shawn Levy, who is pretty much an incompetent as a stylist. By episode 4, it has completely lost the ""vintage feel"" and leaning on the influences of contemporary cable: Let's play a moving piece of rock music over amontage of the different actors staring thoughtfully into space. The music swells... It's the HBO Method of audience intercourse. A directorial cliché. Sorry, but this doesn't have the ""feel"" of a 70s or 80s production at all, maybe a bit in the opening episode or two, but it pretty much is quickly replaced by a run-of-the-mill cable show feel. Vintage Spielberg always had a very kinetic feel. 70s and early 80s films were riffing off the vibe of Altman, Pennebaker, Penn, but sanitizing them a bit and joking them up. The vibe of this series is probably closest in spirit to the lousy cheapie Steven King films, and not in a good way. It's a leaden feel. I'm still skeptical of the ""tribue"" aspect of this show The Winonna""Poltergiest"" ripoff/tribute is the worst bit so far. Where's the dwarf psychic? As I also noted they managed to pay ""homage"" to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Were those nostalgic ""homages?"" If your pose a show as a tribute (and make sure to let people know up front to cover your tracks) does that eradication the icky ""borrowing."" I think a couple of producers (the Duffers you would assume) sat down and said: ""Yeah, I like the kid with powers from FireStarter, let's use that. And the kids from ""It"". The whole kid thing from King. ""Alien"" was a great movie. How about goo? And we'll stay away from the afterlife and just make it a portal to another dimension...."" Add Shaw Levy's teleplay staging (someone should let him know the camera moves) and it's all a bit snoozy. By the way, I also notice that the Duffer Brothers didn't write the series. They farmed out the episodes to a bunch of writer. Right there, their auteur status goes down the drain, IMO. Interestingly, I noticed that the Duffer Brothers wrote the teleplay for Episode 8, but another writer suddenly turns up with a ""story by"" credit (for the first time in the series) for that episode. That tell's me the Duffers' couldn't even figure out how to put a cap on their own series and brought in someone else to make sense of it. And the ending is all pretty perfunctory and predictable. They even managed to reproduce Steven King's most reliable device ... not being able to produce a really satisfying ending. So anyway, that's that. I'd give it a""C."" And warn Steven King to keep his paper covered during the next test."
"Time for the baby boomers to relive period of 80's Pop culture and millennials to have a sneak peak of their aging parents' choices of dresses, music, fashion, games and movies (likes of Back to the future)...

It took me to my fav days of my life..... it's for fans of films of Spielberg like ET, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Gremlins etc. and music of Cyndi Lauper, Duran Duran, Huey Lewis, Wham, Madonna etc...

Rest is all fine intermixed with alien looking monsters, horror, thriller, comedy, romance, emotions, drama etc....

Enjoyed"
"Seriously, one of the best series to watch in 2022. The characters and story magnificant!!

At this moment there is nothing more thrilling than this season!

Super awesome job!!"
"Season 1 of Stranger Things is quite possibly some of the best TV that's ever been produced. Mystery, thrill, and comedy all wrapped into one charming 80s package.

Season 2 takes a slight turn away from the mystery toward more action/thrill, which somewhat takes away from what made this show so special. However, this season also contains some of the best acting, particularly from child actors, that I have ever seen. However, that is somewhat negated by the horrendous train wreck of an episode where the show completely derails from everything they had built up( you will know this episode immediately when you watch it). They corrected their course the following episode and have yet to follow up on some of the plot points they opened up in the dumpster fire.

Season 3. Hm. Once again, moving away from the original tone of the first season towards more horror/sci-fi than mystery and thrill. However, it's good TV nonetheless and will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it."
"Stranger Things is a mash up of Sci-Fi horror that feels fresh in the resulting tale. If you're wondering what it's like, very topically, it's like The X-Files without any UFOs told, largely, from a kid's point of view. The child actors in the story are all excellent and the adult interaction is there too. You'll be attached to the cast and there's even the requisite bad folks too, all in addition to a nasty monster. It's an out-there story much like Steven King meets John Carpenter so, in spite of it's crazy nature it has a good quality which propels it nicely.

The kids here just nail it. That wide-eyed ""anything's possible"" ethos is front and center. They make it fun to watch this story because they're so natural and lovable. They meet an exceptional girl simply called ""11"" due to her nature of being a product of some strange government experimentation resulting in, for lack of any other term, superpowers. She's certainly been damaged in the process and after just one episode you won't be able to imagine this crucial role being better portrayed than by the young actress Millie Bobby Brown. She's incredible in her fragility and broken youth. The other youngsters are just as good and all deserve high accolades. Then there's the adults of whom David Harbour, the town police chief, builds an important bond with the viewer. In his own loss he's become a bit of a loose cannon mess. He's about to go too far in his life and job when the small Hawkins community suddenly goes him a few better. He's the first one to sense a sinister government is behind the high-strangeness making his character one the viewer will latch on to and fully get behind.

I'd say a wild story like this could have easily gone off the rails, but it never does. The Duffer Brothers who wrote and guided it deserve much credit as I'm sure it wasn't easy finding the mix of young actors/actresses to properly pull it off. They nailed it all around. It feels like a quality big-budget movie instead of just another Sci-Fi mini-series. If you like both Steven King and The X-Files I would practically guarantee you'll find Stranger Things right to your liking. Even fleshed out at eight episodes it's definitely good enough to go another season if the writing and acting levels are sustained."
"Not as big of a disappointment as True Detective: Season 2, but close.

This series, unlike TD, had the advantage of giving us the same characters and locations we came to know (and perhaps love) in the first season -- enough familiarity to satisfy the casual viewer at any rate, but hardly quality TV. Just as with True Detective, I kept wondering whether to turn it off, whereas season 1 was binge fodder if I ever saw it.

What's really frustrating, though, is seeing all the deliberate yet unnecessary missteps made by the Duffer brothers. They got into their heads that because it would be unfair to the supporting cast or because we might be fed up with Mike that it would be a good idea to offer these same secondary characters more screen time. Wrong. Dustin was given some of the most cringe-worthy and unbelievable lines of dialogue in the whole series, and Lucas's forced romance with Max had zero chemistry. We also had to deal with a tedious love triangle (surrounding Nancy) that had already been given satisfactory closure at the end of season one.

Next, why all the off-tone scenes? The inexplicable moment in which Billy and Mike's mom have an impromptu flirting session should clearly have been cut from the final product. What about the absurd bond that Dustin appears to create with the demodog?

All this contributed to turning what would have perhaps been a passable-to-mediocre sequel into something genuinely bad.

The Duffer Brothers would do best to take a long break from screen-writing until they find some real inspiration, rather than continue phoning it in for big bucks and fan service, they lest they ruin what could have been a unique and valuable franchise. And please, let's just pretend Chicago and episode 7 never even happened!"
"Summary

The fourth season of ST (divided into two blocks of different number of chapters) expands the scenarios of its battles, provides more information about its monsters, ties up loose ends, and masterfully combines the real and mental planes in which its action takes place.

The Duffer Brothers maintain control of the story and its complex narrative structure (again with very good parallel montages) and know how to converge subplots and characters to culminate their series that reaches cinematographic breath with spectacular, monumental, exciting and simply anthological final chapters. .

Review

I confess I was late to the Stranger Things (ST) universe. At the time, I had abandoned it prematurely, thinking that she was a nonsense about and with children, pubescents and adolescents.

But a month ago I restarted it, going through between two and three chapters every night, and sooner rather than later I became aware (this time yes) of the successful terrifying content of this science fiction series with portals to alternative worlds and monsters, which constitutes a memorabilia and a great compendium of all the horror of the eighties and also before (the list of references is huge, going through Carrie, Gremlins, The Exorcist, Alien, ET, Invasion of the body snatchers, Freddy Krueger movies, It and... complete you list). And above all, note that the underworld of ST is clearly Lovecraftian stamp.

ST undertakes it against a whole series of topics of the US society of the 80s and its cinematographic approach: schools, bullying, generational clashes (the children in this series stand up to adults as equals), the conspiracy and the CIA, the Cold War, sexual awakening, the naturalized relationship of that society with weapons, since childhood. And, of course, a soundtrack with original electronic music that mimics that of Tangerine Dream and that rescues great songs of the time.

ST never recovers the mystery of its Season 1, but manages to find variants to a story that basically repeats itself season after season: the battle of a gang of boys against the monsters of an underworld (""the other side""), the portals and the ways in which they manifest. The narrative structure is always based on the encounter, disagreement and reunion of characters or groups of characters, preserving the ability to go from humor to terror (the underworld and its monsters and the nursery laboratory where Eleven grew up are terrifying) without scales, and increasing the spectacularity and the action with the passing of the seasons. Like all fiction that pays tribute (basically) to the 80s, it had to become more ""pop corn"". The credibility of the story manages to be maintained through all the seasons.

ST does not skimp on truculence and horror, although on the sexual level it always maintained modesty. Undoubtedly, one of the hottest and most transgressive moments of the series occurs with the meeting of Karen Wheeler (mother of Nancy and Mike) with the sexy bath boy Billy, Max's stepbrother. By the way, that funny ignorance of the Wheeler couple about everything their daughter and son did, showed a family where two brothers lived lying to their parents and without communicating with each other and a dissatisfied mother and wife where perhaps what prevailed was in reality disinterest. The fact is that the North American family is another of the institutions questioned by ST, either in the explicitly broken version, such as Joyce's (Winona Ryder) and her children, Will and Jonathan's or the seemingly perfect Wheeler. It is even striking how in T1 the families of some children (like Dustin) do not even appear, even in critical situations, a detail that they seek to fix from T2.

Like all good fiction, ST manages to put together a gallery of powerful and endearing characters led by an excellent cast, starting with Eleven, whose infinite desolation Millie Bobby Brown knows how to convey very well. In addition, it has been able to process the passage from childhood to adolescence of its main characters (it even teases itself -and other series like Euphoria, which eternalize their actors as teenagers- with the character of the repeating student from Season 4 Eddie Munson, taking into account that the actor who plays him is 29 years old that is noticeable).

About Season 4:

In various ways and by different means, all the characters in the series return to battle the monsters from the ""other side"". The story provides more information about that kind of underworld.

The fourth season is divided into two ""volumes"" of different number of chapters. All exceed one hour in duration and some reach an hour and a half and another more than two hours in duration. All the subplots are perfectly integrated, but one of them, which takes place in Russia, is the most conventional and suffers from the rhythm of the story , and includes comedy elements that for the first time do not work well in the series.

S4 rounds up the information about the underworld and its monsters and ties up loose ends. The battles and some encounters of the characters take place on a real level and on a mental level, which leads to a sophisticated staging that perfectly integrates both planes and scenarios (also the real plane includes this world and the ""other side"") ). In addition, extensive segments starring Eleven give even more of a twist to this issue.

The production is stunning. The ""other side"" becomes more complex and its aesthetic achieves moments that combine beauty, horror and imposingness in its description of a Lovecraftian universe. As for the characters, certain romantic issues (said or unspoken) continue to float in the air. The moments of ""rest"" and introspective and their dialogues are not always effective. But we must also take into account that in a series that appeals to reference, the cliché is an element that must be present in some of those dialogues.

Some new characters are added to the stable cast, and some become highly relevant as the chapters go by. As stated above, several of the actors and actresses have grown quite a bit but they are not out of place as members of the different groups or gangs. The cast maintains all its charm and solvency, although Eleven adds new chapters to her martyrdom, giving her character and her powers not only the edge of a superhero but, perhaps, of a saint.

Beyond its potholes, the series achieves moments of great tension. The Duffer Brothers maintain control of the story and its complex narrative structure (again with very good parallel montages) and know how to converge subplots and characters to culminate their series with a cinematographic breath expressed in spectacular, monumental, exciting and simply anthological chapters."
"This was the weakest of the three seasons. Too much comedy, plus the imbecile and unrealistic Russian thread. Instead of a smart storyline and new ideas they tried to fill the plot with comedy and an alian-type monster."
"The magic they got in the first 2 seasons...they lost it in season 3. far too much dialogue, attempted humor in every (i mean every) scene takes all the tension and darkness out of it..the main characters from the first 2 seasons are no longer who they used to be....they have all turned into stupid morons who stand around arguing about inane irrelevancies at the height of the action in an attempt to inject humor (always in the wrong places) Overall, season 3 is badly written, lacks any real tension, tries far too hard to be funny, far too much dialogue and far too little story. Very disappointing, but not really surprising...season 1 = 9/10. season 2 = 8/10. season 3 = 6/10. i think the outlook for season 4 is more of the same....stranger things has now morphed (degenerated more like) into your typical ensemble cast drama/comedy/horror/comfort food entertainment series. Still satisfying in places, still has its moments but nothing special like S1 and S2 to an extent."
"""This is one of a hell masterpiece, alright this is gonna be a very long review, alright one by one ok get ready, season 1 is a crazy season like i am never seen a series with the opening like that like the first 5 minutes the climax it's began like it's so fast for just 1 episode, but that's awesome, there's a lot happen on season we intruduced by this 4 group and then 1 is eating by the monster, lot of crazy stuff happening start from gory to really weird, and then they intruduced eleven (millie bobby brown character), with her superpower, balds hair, don't know lot of words, that's is a perfect choosing look and personality, it's end with el says goodbye to mike who actually the real things is she still alive and beat the monster, season 2 for me is getting more interested because in season 1 i can say there's not a lot of character in there but season 2 is more of a added character, season 2 is more crazier, begins with the monster who still live in Will body, season 2 intruduced l ot of new and important character especially Max and Billy character here, El is actually still alive and live with Jim Hooper, and the interesting things in here that we more know about El life, from her sister and her mother, and i think that's a really good story to tell about, and they ended with a crazy and awesome scene, and the dancing scene in the end just ok but still awesome, now season 3 hey they grow up! they voice changing!, season 3 is more growing up rather than season 1 and 2 you know because they age too, now season 3 i more grown up because you know a kissing scene between El and Mike in the very first episode is kinda disturbing me , and then we got intruduced again by this new kinda important character too, season 3 is very different if we see season they're mission are same and the place is same too, in season 3 the mission kinda different but but connected too, and in the different place, season 3 for me is the best season from the last 2 season, more creepy, more crazy, and of course more awesome, they ended very perfect and very emotional, the color, the shot it's just amazing, this marathon that i'm doing 3 days in a row will be remembered till i grow up, and this series will never been forget, i have never seen a series like this before how emotional and how crazy this is, acting no doubt perfect, a character build up perfect, some reference is very cool, and for the love story between El and Mike i just want to write this 4 sentence ""i hate they relationship"" even thought they just like kissing i still hate that but at least they nit having sex, and you know the most enjoyable,fun,and one of the most important character here is Murray character i really like that guy, and what i really sad is when Jim death, oh you know i'm crying yes i don't care but i like literally crying and saying his name, that's all my review i'm ready for season 4 my hope for season 4 is one bring back Jim, that's all i need, and yes i really hate the jumpscare, it's unexpected and loud, seriously there's a million jumpscare here, last words for me is Friends Don 't Lie"""
"The tone of this show has greatly shifted from mystery-horror to comedy-horror, which is not what I signed up for in the first place.

S1 and S2 had a good storyline with the twists and turns, and the dialogue's witty, the direction is on point, the whole ensemble cast are perfect, the costumes, sets, score are all very fitting.

S3 on the other hand, takes a different turn; most of the main characters are not at acting like themselves; Hopper and Joyce spend the entire binkering and nothing else, Steve can't talk to girls now, and do the parents even care about their children's whereabout anymore?

And the Russian angle, urrgh it's so clichè, and they're portrayed as cartoonishingly evil. They pose no real threat, they are simply there to be outsmarted by our protagonists. And You can just go down to the their 'secret facility' whenever you want, and you'll never get spotted.

The scene where Dustin and Suzie started to sing, was atrocious, instead on focusing on the protagonist's endangered lives they choose to waste everyone's suspension on basically nothing. It's a similar thing throughout the season that the characters don't seem to show proper seriousness. And also standing and looking shocked while they should be running for their lives, or the lives of their friends.

Monster has many chances of killing people off but never do, mostly because every main character has plot armor and will be saved in the last-second-style clichè.

While in the previous seasons, and especially in season one, it looked like there was some genuine effort put in accurately reproducing some of the 80's atmosphere, in season 3 this effort was really sloppy and negligent, if not totally abandoned.

I really hope this show bounce back with S4."
"Extremely overrated and full of plot holes if you examine it too closely, The main girl child actor is NOT as good as everyone says, i find her actually very untalented. Also the whole show has a ""disneyified"" feel where nothing's actually scary or dark but light-hearted and silly"
"The first two seasons of this show were so good! I even rewatched them before the third season was starting. And then..the third season. What a letdown. It seemed like they were more concerned with putting in 80's references than keeping the shows interesting and engaging storyline from the first two seasons. If you're debating whether to watch the show or not, watch the first two seasons and stop there!"
"I loved this show for the first 3 seasons. If I would have rated it back when I would have given it a solid 8.

However, the show creators decided to give us 90 min episodes with next to zero added value for that time. The result is the a thin layer of everything which completely misses the spot.

A word about the villain looks as it's worth mentioning. Gone are the days of strange creatures. Here come a Freddie Krueger style monster.

What can I say. Season 4 simply ruined it for me.

I can't recommend this season to anyone."
"Netflix delivers another amazing original series with Stranger Things. The show mixes science fiction, horror, adventure, mystery, and teenage romance while throwing in lighthearted comedy and a deeper emotional core. It hearkens back to the Spielberg films with an optimistic undertone and a small town 1980s setting. I enjoyed every episode and the momentum rises all the way to the last shot of the first season. I sincerely hope this show returns for another round.

This Netflix series is just great, fun, entertaining, stunning special-effects, and a plot that will blow viewers away. The acting is wonderful and brings to life characters that are easy to root for. Plenty of laughs to be had throughout and each episode ends with a cliffhanger that makes this show incredibly bingeable.

The show has plenty of intense scenes of horror and utilizes every moment of the eight episodes to push the story along. The Duffer Brothers have delivered a gem capitalizing on nostalgia and delivering a fun, yet complex plot. Anyone with a Netflix subscription should check this show out and I'll be shocked if you don't enjoy it.

After season 2: Netflix's 80s tribute and sci-fi adventure returns with another great season of monsters, twists, and a charismatic cast. The film begins with a bizarre scene where a group of punks flee including Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) who shares a similar tattoo to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) continues to reach out to Eleven over the radio but he never hears anything. Eleven is hiding out in a cabin with Jim Hopper (David Harbour), kept isolated from nearby Hawkins. Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are obsessed over a mysterious MadMax who continues to beat their high scores. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) has some residual effects of staying in the upside down for so long and will warp into the other dimension to see a giant monster approaching. His mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) worries for her son and has started a new relationship with Bob (Sean Astin), a technology expert.

Mike's older sister Nancy (Natalia Dyer) continues to try to learn more about her missing friend Barb, enlisting of Will's older brother Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) much to the detriment of her relationship with Steve Harrington (Joe Keery). The new characters in town are Maxine (Sadie Sink) aka Max who has been beating Dustin's high scores and her bully of a stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery). As the monster slowly creeps towards Will, stranger things happen around Hawkins even as Chief Hopper makes an arrangement with the Department of Energy's new project leader Dr. Sam Owens (Paul Reiser). Pumpkins patches are dying and the scientists continue to try to burn out the encroaching substance from the dimension hole. Halloween comes as the boys dress up as Ghostbusters. Jonathan is supposed to watch Will but he leaves to hang out with Nancy at a party where she has got obnoxiously drunk and fought with Steve.

"This show is absolutely outstanding and definitely my favorite TV show. The music and style is absolutely incredible, it perfectly blends old and new. The characters are all very well done and their relationships are something you actually care about. It isn't exactly scary but it can be very intense and the monsters are very cool. The first season has cgi that feels a little like a tv show budget but they go all out for season 2 and 3, the cgi looks absolutely wonderful and it is not something you'd expect from your average tv show.

100% recommend this show!"
"Even though I often find movies on IMDb overrated, I was expecting something good from this because of the 9.3. I am convinced that this is a case of the people rating something highly be cause it seems like it should be good. yes, its got lots of references from the 80s, but that does not mean its any good. We'll start with the worst dialogue ever. there were several places where the writings was so bad and you could actually see it straining to be funny. Worst in this department were the three screechy kids. One of them was a kind of hybrid character of GOONIES' Chunk, and Stand by Me's Vern. The chemistry between him and the black kid just missed the mark, the dead pan was never deadpan enough and the ""clever dialogue"" bits fell flat. although I' admit the other kid actually seemed to fit in the time and place being represented. Winona Ryder. She is so hit and miss. There are moments when she seems quite believable as the character but at other times ....just not. Worst though, might be the lack of originality, with ideas being stolen from all sorts of 80s titles. The 80s atmosphere felt less like the 80s and more like some a version of what a current have imagined it would be like from their distorted 2016 perception."
"Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of horror but this show proved me wrong in so many ways! If there was the option, I'd give this show 10000000000/10! First of all, the storyline is just incredible and so interesting for anyone watching. The characters are also incredible. Max and Will are just incredible and impeccable. Also the actors are flawless! Millie Bobby Brown and Sadie Sink have grown to be my idols and there are very many inspiring people in this show for kids. Absolutely flawless show and the best thing I've ever seen on TV. I'm so thankful we were given this masterpiece."
"Stranger Things is another very good offering from Netflix.. it certainly holds its own with the best in the horror genre on TV.. a stronger area than some would have us believe.. Walking Dead, American Horror, Penny Dreadful, Outcast.. strong performers all. As someone who grew up in the 80s the cultural references in this are off the charts.. you can see what they watched and read for inspiration, It, the Langoliers, ET... even Predator.. apart from some fairly obvious reasons heres a great one for fans of the Arnie classic... Jim Hopper saves Hawkins from the monster... My one minor complaint is that at a couple of points the cgi/green screen is a bit dodgy. The make up, sets, acting, direction and writing make up for it though and most of the visual FX are decent.. It is left for a season 2 if there will be one, but not to worry it's not left on a cliffhanger which is always a relief. All in all another great one for a binge session."
Series are satisfying. First is the best one because of originality but if you like supernatural and mystery see it all. Other aspects of fabula are also good.
"I was one of those what said I'm not watching that crap, looks crap. Lol how wrong was I!!! Watched first episode out of boredom having a beer and wow, I got hooked. Give it a try you will not be disappointed. Now I'm waiting for the last 2 episodes eagerly lol."
First two seasons were pretty good. Third one comes along and everyone wants to be too cute by half. Unwatchable.
"The plot was superficial and at the same time confusing, despite the very good main cast. Good chemistry between characters wasted on feminist or lgbt propaganda. Cliches. Lots of cliches. Unnecessary quotations. Too many ads. The soundtrack and the beautiful footage are still the strengths."
"It's shocking how good this show is, seriously. The pacing, the cinematography, the casting, the chemistry between the cast, the 80's references, the fantasy and D&D references, the acting, the editing,....just everything. It's a masterpiece and I for one am sad that Season 5 will be the last. I'm not sure what the spinoff will be about or who will continue in it, but if the Duffer Brothers are involved, then count me in! I'd also be super pumped for a movie with the original cast some day down the road, as it would be interesting to see them grown up and crazy things still happening in Hawkins."
"Solid stories, great characters, great themes, and vibes. Enjoyable and addicting.

The characters were developed greatly through the season. Very well-made monsters! I love the soundtracks of every season, always have the iconic one.

This is a must-watch series! Really. Can't wait for the final season."
"The first two seasons of Stranger things really set the plot well and gets you hooked immediately. Set in the 1980's, the actors portray what it was like in these times to perfection bringing out nostalgia of the time.

It is not so often that a hit series will feature children as the lead characters, which is another reason as to why Stranger Things is so highly rated among viewers. It is a show which is unique and provides Netflix the opportunity to continue the very interesting storyline."
"This series is more than just a itch scratcher for 1980s nostalgia, it's an almost perfect re-imagination of a genre not replicated since the 1980s; movie Super 8 looks clumsy and is boring compared to this excellent series. The characters look 80s, the casting itself is very 1980s, nerdy kids and their nerdy friends with bad 80's hair. The language and style of acting is also very 80s but it's more of a streamlined 1980s, the editing, direction and cinematography, lighting is better than your typical 80's Goonies or even ET I think. I must emphasize that this is a grown up version of the 80s ET type genre, people get shot in the head etc and teenage kids rendezvous in the toilets to make out etc so it's not that innocent comedic thread that runs right the way through ET for example although there are many moments like that particularly with the main group of protagonist kids. I must say that the costumes, sets and the props (BMX bikes, giant walkie talkies, HAM radio kits, 80s circular telephone dials, 80s style houses in small town America, big 80s American cars etc go a long way to making this look authentic. What can I say, this is truly excellent and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. In some ways this is the ultimate love letter to Steven Spielberg, it's a labour of love and just doesn't it show it...."
"The haters need to calm down! They only wanna hate this show because it's popular. You can like mainstream things without being basic.

I think each season shows the continued growth and maturity the characters develop. Season 4 wasn't full of as much goofiness as past seasons. It has more of a dark, serious adult tone and I can appreciate that effort from the writers. The script has emotion without being cheesy. It bounces around from story to story but it's easy to follow and it pays off in the end when the dots all connect. The score and cinematography are top notch as well.

Overall, this is truly a standout series. Worth the watch and worth all the hype."
"Season 3 stinks. There are many reasons many reasons for this, but primarily the following: The coming of age story is unavoidable, but it often looks like ""Stand By Me"" meets ""Ghostbusters"" and the teen angst wears pretty thin. If you ever saw the ""Goosebumps"" series, this will seem like an R rated flashback. Those pesky kids are at it again.... they just need Scooby Doo and the Mystery Machine van. Apparently screaming your lines is an indicator of serious acting because there is a lot of that, and these are serious actors aren't they? I could barely tolerate the slime monster or un-killable super human hosts. Possibly they could barely tolerate it themselves and we're glad to dissolve into goo. A disappointment after a good first season and a less good second season. I wish I had more than two thumbs down to give it."
"For years I looked at this show and thought to myself ""this is some stupid kid show there's no way it lives up to its hype"". I'm here to say that I was gladly mistaken by a long shot. The storyline is meticulous in building this world similar to the style of Stephen King. It is set in the 80's surrounding a group of adventurous kids who love science and playing D&D. It's quite ironic that they always seem to find themselves in unspeakable scenarios that seem quite similar to the game they love so much. It all starts when one of their buddies goes missing and they come across a new friend, a young girl with powers who doesn't speak much but seems to be connected to the disappearance of their friend. The kids play their roles wonderfully, even alongside the veteran actress Winona Ryder. There's also the older teen group who find themselves entwined in the same creepy situations as the younger kids. They often find themselves working together as the adults probably wouldn't believe the monstrosities they have witnessed. Jim Hopper is the macho man sheriff who is the protector of the town with a troubled past which has shaped him into the man he is. The spookiness of the show is often followed up with some comic relief which will have you filled with suspense while laughing at the same time. Especially that of one of the kids, Dustin who has a condition with his teeth that gives him a lisp that only makes him funnier. Murray also provides much of the shows comedy, he's a conspiracy theorist who to regular folks seems like a straight up nutcase obsessed with crazy Soviet Union theories. However, to those in Hawkins aware of the things happening around them his theories will be more than helpful.

Season 4: 10/10 Season 3: 9.5/10 Season 1: 9.2/10 Season 2: 9/10."
"I just now binge-watched the entire S4 with a few hours of sleep in the middle. Really good season, almost as good as S1 but not quite.

When the show first came out in 2016, I immediately fell in love with it and was hooked from start to finish. It did things to my heart and eyes that few other shows or movies do.

Season 2 started off fine, but fell off after a while, and Season 3 was cringe overload and often felt like a chore to get through, and by the end of S3 it had me feeling disinterested, and I actually forgot what happened and had to do a quick skim through S3 to brush up on the details before finally, reluctantly, going into S4 that I initially felt indifference to watching.

However, from the first minute of the first episode of S4, I was pleasantly surprised, re-engaged, and rekindled my interest. It made my heart and eyes feel things again within the show. There were however some weird things in S4 that broke my immersion, such as various cringe dialogue moments, obvious and flat-looking facial/bodily CGI in places, and Will, Mike & Jonathan being relegated to very little screen time throughout much of S4 despite their core importance to S1.

S3 made me feel irritated by Max and Lucas, and when initially seeing them in S4, I felt ""oh no not this again"", however S4 turned me around and made them engaging characters.

And then the ending episode of S4... good overall, but felt like it lacked a crescendo, payoff, or resolve, as Eddie's death was largely brushed over and forgotten, despite the entire season being centred around the town's assumption that he did the murders. The police who were looking for him were around from the start of the season, but were never seen or heard from again after the kids escaped the house and cycled off, around halfway through the show. So that arc of the manhunt for Eddie just never got resolved.

So overall, S4 is not without its flaws, but it really did feel more engaging and interesting than most of the stuff Stranger Things offered since S1. I just feel that with more polishing and test screening before release, S4 could have been perfected.

Overall, I'd give S4 an 8 or 9 out of 10, which could have been a 10/10 if they'd have given Will, Mike & Jonathan more to do, and given proper payoffs in the final episode. This may have required a whole extra episode to allow for the essential changes, but that would have definitely been worth the wait imo.

I'm now looking forward to S5 as opposed to the ending of S3 having me disinterested. Now to re-watch Season 1 again for the first time in ages. I can already feel my heart bracing..."
"To be frank, the first two seasons weren't as memorable as the third and fourth seasons. It took a while till I got through the first season due to its irregular pacing and mundane story. The second season, however, rejuvenated the series thanks to the introduction of Max, and Steve and Dustin's dynamic. The third season may be the single greatest piece of television I have ever seen. Steve, Robin, Dustin, Max, and Jane 'Eleven' Hopper are easily my favourite characters from Stranger Things. The camaraderie between the characters is palpable from the second season onwards. In my opinion, the first season is overrated, forgettable, and quite underwhelming. Most of the characters were unlikeable but improved in season 2 and 3. I was willing to give the series the benefit of the doubt, and I am glad I stuck with it. The soundtrack of Stranger Things has always stood out, but it only left a real impression on me in seasons 3 and 4. Every season introduces new characters that don't outshine the original, rather revitalises the series. At its core, Stranger Things is a character driven show, emphasising on the character interactions rather than the action and visual effects. The visual effects are top-notch, and one of the best I have seen on a television show, but it doesn't take centre stage. I prefer seeing these characters interact with each other rather than constantly having action set pieces. Sadie Sink as Max Hayfield fully embodies the character, especially during season 4. She is one of the many stand-out actors on the show. I love how the audience sees a completely different side of the character in the fourth season, as opposed to the previous seasons. Max is known for her sassy, quirky, and upbeat personality. After her stepbrother Billy Hargrove was killed by the mind flayer, Max spiralled out of control and became an outcast in school and avoided her close-knit friend group. The fourth episode of the fourth season titled ""Dear Billy"" is one of the finest episodes of Stranger Things and my personal favourite overall. Max trying to escape Vecna's clutches, while the 1980's pop song ""Running Up That Hill"" by Kate Bush is playing in the outside world is perfect and makes this scene even better and stylistically sound. After finishing season 4 volume 1, I downloaded Kate Bush's ""Running Up That Hill"" and listened to it on a loop.

Nitpick: The depiction of smoking might seem off-putting for some viewers (at least for me)

Final verdict: 9.2/10."
"This is by far the best series on netflix!

I started watched this serie four weeks ago and it only took me two weeks to finish it.

I feel like I went through some kind of adventure with this series during those couple of weeks, and I was totally involved in it all and kept well connected to the plot. And this 2.5-hour episode was a good ending to this fourth season. Waiting for the next and last season.

I've been looking for a series that would capture my heart for a long time, I haven't been interested in any series for a long time, and the series I've started watching have been left unfinished. And so I decided to give Stranger Things a chance, and luckily I did. Stranger Things really stole my heart, and I was totally hooked!

I liked I fell in love, and I fell so madly in love with this series

My favorite character in the series is Max. I started to like it right from the start, but not so much yet, but in season four, Max was by far the best. I just loved all the characters to be honest!

Soundtracks, actors, atmosphere and actually everything works in this series!"
"When you stretch the run-time of each episode of your already lengthy 9-episode season to over an hour-long, culminating in a mammoth 2-hour long finale, the makers of Stranger Things needed to ensure that the narrative justified its length and the time invested by the viewers. And the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy achieve just that, seamlessly combining the coming-of-age and horror-thriller genres to deliver a sparkling, almost-cinematic experience that will set new benchmarks on the levels a series can aspire to reach.

We rejoin our beloved Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and her rag-tag bunch of compatriots as they look to navigate the vagaries of high school, all-the-while keeping at bay the nefarious forces of the other-dimensional ""Upside down"", where a new power has surfaced, a demonic being known as ""Vecna"". While the core coming-of-age storyline continues to go from strength to strength, the makers deftly split the narrative into three branches, deftly switching back and forth between the POVs of Eleven, her adopted father ""Hopper"" who is trapped in Russia and the enterprising ""Dustin"", my personal favorite character in the entire franchise.

The throwback references to the 1980s, where the story takes place, add a superlative charm to the proceedings, with everything from vintage brands to metal music weaved neatly into the storytelling. The writing is top-notch as usual and how they manage to give each one of its 15+ main characters a compelling story arc with seemingly equal importance is beyond my comprehension. Because of the same, it is very difficult to pick a stand-out performer, with everyone from David Harbour (""Hopper"") to John Keery (""Steve Harrington"") turning in eye-catching portrayals, and even the newly introduced characters like ""Argyle"" and ""Eddy Munson"" make their presence felt.

The only downside of the 4th season is the romance tracks which seem forced and contrived in places, with the writers seemingly drumming up conflicts where there naturally aren't any and deliberately leaving behind loose ends and unanswered questions just to build anticipation for Season 6, said to be the final season of the franchise. Due to these small shortfalls, Volume 4 will still lag behind the landmark Volumes 1 & 2 for me but still manages to deliver a satisfying, immensely binge-worthy viewing experience. Recommended!"
"I was full of hope when I watched the pilot for this highly rated and very popular series. After the pilot I was bewildered as to why the vast number of viewers have given this wishy-washy show such outrageously high ratings! There is nothing new being done here and the quality is mediocre, IMHO!

But I decided to watch another episode, just in case the material got better. I, however, gave up towards the end of it. I found it so boring and basically just annoying. This series hardly deserves even one star; it's dreadful!

I found the acting to be mostly mediocre, as well as the material. Winona Ryder is overplaying her role with too much hysteria. Other actors are just so so..."
"But I was drawn in by its strong ratings, and I am pleased I did. This review covers S1, 2 and 3 which I watched over about a week.

For me, S3 was the strongest, and it was really down to the humour.

I was surprised, flicking through some of the other user reviews, that only one other I read mentioned the humour. I really loved the lively attacks on the prejudices of class, race, gender and much more. Most of the cast coped brilliantly with the demands made on them. S3 really zinged along with great energy and it was a delightful romp.

Just at the end I felt a bit of anticlimax but I guess it was inevitable given that the story was less powerful than the humour.

S4 is about to hit the streams, so I hope it doesn't disappoint."
"Season 1 good, season 2 okay, season 3 horrible-typical Hollywood style cheesy comedy"
"This is my fav series I've ever watched, I never want it to end !!!!! Honestly everyone needs to watch this, each series has got better and better.

Can't wait for v2 of series 4 going to be a good one."
Boring and misogynistic. Not keeping my interest at all.
"Being that I was their age when the movie takes place, probably has more meaning to us Gen X group.

I was nervous that S04 would have been sold into ""sleep and quit"" mind slavery, but they pulled it off.

Any series you watch at least 3 or more times earns 9.5 or higher, but since this was 4 seasons to date, it rates a full 10.

A note for the younger crowd, only the super nerdy geeks played Dungeons and Dragons back then. And yes I know that for a fact. Tying D&D into this whole series was really neat and a nice journey back to the 80s-- malls, and actually talking on a land line telephone.

They went a bit overboard on the whole surfer stoner guy. Was it forced to have a trans counselor from their school!? I wish they played more popular 80s music in all 4 seasons-- being that music was very much a part of the what really made the 80s. The background synth music in the score more than made up for it, but still 80s really was about how the music shaped the 80s.

A visit with Suzie was a nice surprise and home life there was even more of a didn't see it coming surprise.

S04 started out a bit anticlimactic and a bit Smallville-ish, since we waited 3 years. Character development started flat and didn't have the charm or wonder as it did in S01. Almost like they didn't know how to develop them. The build up to see what was going on took a bit longer, or rather nothing was really happening to get to that point.

They pulled it off though, once they got it kick started, with a very nice season ending. I do think though for shock value and to emphasize their struggle and pain, that the one main character in question should have been sacrificed. The fact that it maybe 2 more years before the season 5 finale, very sad and depressing.

Thanks for the awesome adventure... 1982 only seemed like a few years ago to be honest."
"Reviewing after watching part 1 of season 4, but I think this show hits a home run on Season 4. The people involved with making this show deserve a victory lap, and should be very happy with what they have accomplished. It has the hollywood magic most blockbuster tv and movies fail to achieve nowadays."
Did not care for season 4. Too much filler and too much stupidity. The only reason I'm finishing this season is that my family wants to watch. I won't watch season 5.
"Season one. Very fun 9 out of 10 Season two. Some fun with a bit of silliness 7 out of 10 Season three. ""We give up but we got paid so just randomly throw out some stuff with Russians"" 5 out of 10"
A best horror fantasy and SciFi series. Millie brown performance was top notched and other also doing well in their roles. Finally A must watch series for all.
"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute."
"The first 2 seasons were really good. Highly recommendable. But season 3 is sinking the ship (ahoy). The cool references, extra cash they spent on special effects (gore and other things), and bad language are all overdone. Most importantly, the story and storytelling was not good. The kids are losing their innocence, which is disappointing. This originally seemed aimed at bringing together tweens and adults to watch, but not sure I would want my kids watching this. This is an example of something that does a bad job of keeping a target audience. I get the feeling the Duffers are ready to move on. Me too."
"OK, I know I'm late to the party but glad I made it! I'm a predominantly fan of films rather than tv series (which is a reason why I hadn't watched it yet), but having run out of films to watch (mainly due to few releases because of the pandemic) I finally watched it. And I'm glad I did!

My problem with tv series vs movies is how do you keep everything seem fresh and enjoyable for more than 1 hour 30 minutes? I love how film manages to get a story into a small timeframe whilst introducing key characters and their backstories. Too many times I find that tv series elongate screen time by adding backstories and other ""information"" that does little for entertainment but explains about the characters. Apart from some instances of this for the psionic Elle, it was hardly evident anywhere. Instead, the writing allows all the characters to live their own lives and interact with each other with their own unique personalities whilst dealing with all the things that go on around them.

I watched series 1 and loved it so much that I didn't want to start the second incase it didn't live up to that standard. Although the second dipped in parts, in my opinion (the episode where Elle finds out about her past wasn't my favourite), it still hit so many levels, such as heartfelt emotion, laughs and drama. The writing, effects, acting, score (I love eighties music!) and direction are exemplary.

Will the third series be as good? I hope so. I can't wait to find out."
"I grew up watching a lot of 90's show where the main protagonist has some kind of super powers and this show is no different.

The fact that it's tagged as Horror has nothing to do with ""horror"". Its like a toned down version of E.T movie for 8 year old kids.

The show is mostly about a bunch of kids fighting to make themselves heard in an adult world, this is why this show is so popular among kids. The ""horror"" part of the movie is just an after thought.

Stranger things keeps baiting the audience by dangling little hints of horror and super powers in 3 secs scenes just to keep the audience entertained and hooked, but the rest of the screen time is just petty problems of kids and adolescents trying to do the right things."
"Boring. In season 1 there were: monsters, action, mystery, magic! In season 3 only what you've got is one monster... and love, LOVE and more LOVE between every single character. So boring and disappointed."
"I have watched this show over, and over, and over again. Every single time I find something new to laugh at, be frightened by, or care for deeply. I love this show so, so much. I can't see a single reason why someone would find it boring or uneventful because I still cry at the climax of every season. Well done to every person involved in this show!"
"Not much needs to be said, one of the best shows out there currently and should be watched by everyone at least once in their life. The characters are also probably the best in any movie or TV-show, as they are all VERY well acted and each have a unique, fun and interesting personality."
"Season one was incredible, but season 2 and 3 went bad. This show should have ended after season 1."
"So what we have

1) fat cop chief who is acting like a criminal . looks like a thug or hobo and have never seen any police training and yeah is living in a trailer 2) bunch of stupid kids who act stupid and look stupid and make stupid decisions 3) problem is that the kids are now too old and stupid funy actions only work with young kids but not with teenager where its just dump 4) stupid russians who cant even handle stupid helpless kids 5) stupid alien who by design never hurt any main character

I need to admit that everybody who is able to watch all 8h of this season 3 crap is kinda braindead or should seek medical help

basically everybody on screen is aciting and looking stupid and dumb"
"That's about it. The first season was brilliant, the second one was OK, the third one was barely watchable. If they continue like this in the forth season, it'll be massive disappointment."
"I rarely write a review, but I had to do it after reading some of these other reviews, like it's bad acting all the way. Well, these people probably are used to watching Neighbours or Days of Our Lives and just have no clue about acting in the first place. The kids are great and actually I really like the way Winona Rider plays the mom in this. She looks like the mom that would kill to save her son and that's the point, right?

Also people are saying that ""if you take away the 80's effect, it would not be that good."" Well I guess that if you take away the fantasy effect in Lord of the rings, it would also just be a little boy throwing a ring in a volcano, while he is fighting some gypsies or something, so that argument makes absolutely no sense at all! I mean, come on.. The 80's element is a very important aspect of the series, so stop with this nonsense. Me, personally am a huge fan of this 80's nostalgia feeling and the Duffer brothers did an amazing job recreating this aspect.

So, if you don't just want to watch another CSI or comedy sitcom (nothing wrong with that tho), this is just what you are looking for! It will keep your interest from the first second to the last. You will definitely not get bored watching this! Enjoy!"
"This series was great in its first season, but season 2 and 3 were trash."
"Netflix's prequel series is the best tie-in you'll ever see

The Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy, the creators behind Netflix's Stranger Things, have teamed up for a prequel web series called Stranger Things: The Game that's just as good as the show it's based on.

Stranger Things is a Netflix original series that was released in July 2016. The show is set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the 1980s. The first season follows the disappearance of a young boy named Will Byers, and the ensuing search for him by his mother, Joyce, his friends, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper. The second season, which was released in October 2017, picks up a year after the events of the first season, and follows the characters as they deal with the aftermath of the events of the first season.

The Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy have now teamed up for a prequel web series called Stranger Things: The Game. The web series is a point-and-click adventure game that is set in the months leading up to the events of the first season of the show.

The web series consists of six short episodes, titled ""The Vanishing of Will Byers"", ""The Kidnapped Child"", ""The Darkest Corners"", ""The Missing Pieces"", and ""The Secret Cabin"", and ""The Mind Flayer"". The first four episodes were released on October 3, 2017, with the last two episodes being released on October 31, 2017.

The web series is set prior to the events of the first season of Stranger Things and follows the disappearance of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp). The series also introduces new characters, including Bob Newby (Sean Astin), a kind-hearted stranger who helps the kids, and Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser), a government official who is brought in to help with the investigation into Will's disappearance."
What went wrong with this show? Everything. Season 2 and season 3 were garbage.
"Stranger Things is a total flashback to everything that you loved about the 80's! I had the perfect amount of scare factor, anxiety, and nostalgic qualities that I look for in any TV show.

The Cast of mostly unknown children: Will, Mike, Lucas, & Dustin did a very believable job to sell this story. Don't get me wrong there are a few parts that will make you chuckle during this 8 hour adventure but those same parts to me made it all the better. I loved the premise of the entire show and found myself numerous times wanting to look away or cover my eyes knowing something was coming and I DID NOT want to see it. The score and music in this series was amazing as well.

I am very happy to see Winona Ryder back on TV and she played the Character of Joyce Byers perfectly. Very Believable. I thought her entire performance was great!

The remaining supporting cast was also great. David Harbour as Chief Jim Hopper was great as well. He brought the real emotion and feel to his role and the minor subplot that slowly unravels up to the final reveal was amazing. Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven was also Amazing! Every scene she graced was that much better and just her facial expressions alone showed so much emotion. Her subplot as well was wonderful to watch slowly unwind to the reveal as well.

I really hope they are able to spin this off for a second season and they left us with that ONE single moment to make it possible and for us viewers to cross our fingers and wait.

If you are looking for a great serious with an 80's feel and a fun spin on everything you loved from that era prepare to Binge!"
"I binge watch every season.

The side characters are amazing too. Just loved the internet stuff, threw me back into those dial up days lol.

I really hope they dont try lots of spinoffs, but with the duffle brothers approval they could work."
I love this show season 1 and 2 are gold. I enjoy 3 but you can see the decline begin Its worth a watch but I dont have much hope for 4.
Seasons 1-3 are engaging and entertaining. Season 4? Just total protracted indulgence in anxt. It was a lot of filler and painfully stretched out scenes.
"ET and goonies mix.. awesome! VHS and before fb and internet. Batteries and Walkman's. Phoning your friends house. Simpler times.

Takes some brain power so I'd suggest binging so you know the plot and what's happening. Season one is important.

I love they used kids that age. Much more realistic."
"The genius here is not the phenomenal story, acting or characters, it's the way in which these were melded to appeal across multiple generations like no other series of the past 30 years.

Series 4 was worth the agonising wait, every episode worthy of feature movie status. In particular episode 4 and the finale, truly spectacular. Do yourself a favour if you're one of the remaining sceptics..."
"Very few series manage to maintain a high standard beyond the first season or two. For me, one that did (and is an exceptional tv series in a similar vein to stranger things) is The X-files. The X-files first 2 seasons are very good. But seasons 3-5 are generally considered the classic x-files seasons, and rightly so. Here was a show which went from very good to even better and maintained the highest standard right until the end of season 5. (and we are talking 24 episodes per season!) What's the difference? The show stayed on the track it started out on, maintaining the same winning ideas it introduced in the first season, expanding upon them without abandoning them. OTOH, Stranger Things abandoned most of what made it so good in the first 2 seasons and in season 3 for some reason tried to be a totally different show. There was no continuation of the original vision or even the characters in season 3. There were a few good threads - the backstory of Billy and his final redemption for me was the best thing in season 3. The character of Robin was also worthwhile. All in all i think they had about 3 episodes worth of material, the rest was just unnecessary padding out (and tedious at that) It would not surprise me if the whole 'evil russians' theme (which was so absurd) was paid for by outside political entities to be in the show to help push their own current anti-russian propaganda, ironically the US government secret services who were the villians of season 1 & 2, now become the 'cavalry' who show up at the aftermath. Virtually every single aspect of the show went downhill in season 3. Except one thing, the budget obviously went up big-time. The whole production budget multiplied by many times, including salaries - the result - a way-worse show. Interesting how that works."
"This is one of the best shows I have watched till date . This show is just purely a masterpiece !! Plot twist , action , story , editing , cinematography, every thing is just simply awesome. Give this show a try and it will not disappoint you , the show will only give you surprises !! Casting is perfect , each and every actor is awesome ."
"Bear with this as when I started to watch this I was 10 mins in and I thought it was rubbish but I perceived with it and oh boy I was so pleased I did as it's AMAZING . It really is good and you won't be disappointed, you'll love it ."
"Apart from a couple of bad CG shots and a couple of details in the last episode, the first season of Stranger Things borders on perfection. I won't include any spoilers, but if you like films and books like Carrie, Poltergeist, The Goonies, or The Thing, you will probably enjoy this. A lot. Even more so if you grew up in the 1980s.

The second season is slightly worse, less atmospheric, less mysterious, more focused on action sequences, but definitely still worth watching. Characters still behave more or less in character, with a couple of exceptions. Visual effects are a mixed bag, with the new ""monster"" looking great, but the ones inherited from season 1 still looking fake and badly animated.

The third season, sadly, is a complete mess (both in terms of the overall plot and the behaviour of some characters making no sense). It's still entertaining, in a sillier and more over-the-top kind of way, but it's really closer to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than to the excellent first series. The visual effects are excellent.

On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate the first three seasons 10, 8, and 6, respectively. Hopefully season 4 won't be a 4."
"Each season has its own mood.. I love the first season for its innovative story, but the third season is pure nostalgic fun and by far my fav."
