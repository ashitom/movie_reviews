"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.

The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"
"With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid."
"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.

Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.

Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.

In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.

The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.

So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.

By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.

And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."
"If they could have stopped in season 2, this series would have been the best ever heist series that's ever made. But they didn't do it and season 3 and season 4 is meaningless and boring. Not convincing and illogical."
"I gave season one and two of this show a much deserved 10/10 but I'm at a loss to understand why they made season 3?

Season 3 is the antithesis of the former seasons. It ruins the mostly light hearted vibe that had been established, replacing it with something much darker. Worse still, its simply, in many respects, a blatant re-hash of what went before.

Like Star Wars, this feels like making something for the sake of making it. I'm happy to have had the first two seasons and will be leaving it there.

5/10 for season 3."
"Season 1 was top notch Season 2 kept the intense drama going but started dropping close to end Season 3 We are trailing off, plot devices no longer making sense Season 4 It became obvious that the writers was just writing the craziest stuff possible and throwing it on screen.

Season 5 I stopped after episode 2 because it was all levels of stupidity. I did not care about ANY character and actors became 'cartoonish' where many people are playing over-the-top caricatures. Just sad....really really sad..."
"This is a soap opera, looks like a smart tv show but it's a latin soap opera and you watch it like that(50% brain turned off, the logic part)"
"Let's start with the initial premise: occupying the mint, printing up 2.4 billion in 50-Euro notes, and stealing them. That many notes would weigh 43,200 Kg and occupy a minimum of 29 standard CEN-pallets (each stacked a ridiculous 2.7 meters high), which is five more than will fit in a 40-ft container. The narration tells us they printed 200 million in the first 8 hours, so the whole lot would take 96 hours (4 days), and then it all has to be cut, stacked, wrapped and loaded. So they have to continue their occupation for, say, all together 7 days without the police taking the standard step of CUTTING OFF THE POWER. Then they have to get all that bulk removed, taken to another location, and then what are they going to do with it? Divide it amongst them? Each of them then has at least two pallets, 3,000 Kg, of bulk to carry away?

This is like some late-night stoner idea that nobody with any sense ever intervened in. Are these people from the 1950's? I mean, who steals paper money, anymore? How do they think they'll ever use it? Bank notes have serial numbers, and the word will go out immediately. No bank anywhere will ever accept them in deposit. They cannot be laundered. Anyone with a layman's common sense sees immediately that the whole premise is absurd. It is sweet irony indeed that the author of such a laughably impracticable idea be known as ""The Professor.""

Then there's the stilted, hackneyed dialogue, the clumsy character development, the lazy action sequences. And this is all in the first three episodes. I don't understand my fellow reviewers complaining they ""wasted their time"" on three seasons of this. I'm ending this agony now."
"With some engaging characters and a money heist script with several twists, this started off SO WELL!!!

Unfortunately, however, it would seem that sometime during the first season someone realized they had an audience they wanted to keep around for a while, and from that moment on, it went downhill, quickly. Like a marmalade that will only go so far, they began to water-down the story in order to spread it out for as long as they could make it last, ultimately making it almost unappetizable.

What seemingly would have been a masterpiece if allowed to run in its predetermined time, pace and format, became a stretched-out mess and with so much stretching, something had to give. As in a bad, pieced-together tapestry, this developed so many glaring plot holes that even those who are best blessed at being able to suspend belief in order to enjoy a tv series or film, will eventually find it tedious and disheartening that one needs to do it so DAMN MUCH to keep this story on the rails. Not only are there innumerous plot holes, but the telling of the story grows more and more formulaic by the episode, and is way too often preposterously predictable.

The acting is give or take, and while some of the cast excels, others do not. Worse, still, the characters much like the original title (La Casa De Papel), lack real substance and are merely paper, molded as the scene requires, rather than being given lives and backgrounds and breath and purpose of their own, even though they spout about ""purpose"" almost ad-nauseum.

Then there is the fascination which the creators seem to have with either the actress who plays Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó), or with the character itself or with what Natalie Portman's character in Leon the Professional would have grown up to be like (in their minds). In an effort to make an appealing character, which both men wanted and women could relate to, they bent her into a parody of a damaged superhero with psycho tendencies; an over-the-top, non-sexy, raging-hot, flip-the-switch temper; mommy-issues; street-bike stunt capabilities; good or bad, fighting abilities (depending on the scene); and oh, yes, a heart of gold or titanium or slush, which needs tending to and healing, also depending on the scene. In short, in wanting to create an amazing, powerful lead character, they morphed her into Frankenstein with sultry eyes. She reminds me of the quote from Pride and Prejudice: "" I never saw such a woman. Surely she would be a fearsome thing to behold."" A miss in my book. Raquel too, (played by Itziar Ituño), was denied the opportunity to be at least a somewhat balanced character, but unlike Tokyo's character which is purposefully built up, Raquel's character is a plot device which is torn down repeatedly and made to look ridiculous in many situations in order to further the script. The other characters in the first two seasons, Berlin especially and also The Professor, are written well (with the exception of THAT plot device in seasons 3 and 4 which I will not go into here). The rest of the main cast is pretty likeable on an interchangeable scale. I would be remiss not to also mention José Manuel Poga who plays César Gandía and Najwa Nimri who plays Inspector Alicia Sierra in Seasons 3 and 4. They are two of the toughest 'tough guys' I've seen in a series and do great in their respective roles.

Both despite and because of this, Money Heist (terrible change of title, by the way) engages you - ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES, because it is a whole, undiluted, rich story at the beginning - with fluid, deep moments of brilliance, that unfortunately, come around less-and-less often, until we barely see them at all.

If you are intent on watching it, listen to the bad reviews and go in with very little and low expectations - perhaps you will then, like those who first discovered it, be surprised and will enjoy it. If you go in expecting much, you WILL be disappointed. It rolls over, like a gigantic wet blob, over its' own hype."
"I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I kept put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous but that won't stop you from having fun watching it. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! It's a Spanish show but you can either watch it with subtitles or watch it dubbed in English. Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
The more u watch it.. the dumber it gets.. idea of the plot is good. Direction is just like a soap opera.
"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3

So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead Nairobi

That's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this season

Punch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boring

Gandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnic

So if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenes

An idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!

End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season ""maybe""

In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story there

And what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"You know how it is on a foreign trip. You turn on the hotel TV and if you're not fluent in the language, you zone out and half-follow the picture. And then you have your typical soap opera actors - some of them can't act, but are photogenic, some of them can sort of act and aren't photogenic, and some of them are required only to pretend to be in a coma. Most of them overact (or over non-act), because the scarcity of acting work means they've never come up against a decent director who would have told them to tone it down a bit. Even the guy in a coma.

Wardrobe? Red overalls, mainly. The hairdresser tried really hard, though.

Then there's the script. Obviously, your series creator has got a thing about planting false clues for the forensic team, because the fact that the man with fake irritable bowel syndrome has done this in advance is the main source of suspense - you're supposed to be waiting for the CSI team to catch on. No doubt they will, when they get over their break-up issues.

Then the man who doesn't have Stockholm syndrome - a syndrome from Stockholm, they explain - tries to explain to the woman who does have Stockholm syndrome (from Stockholm) that it's just not going to work out between them. Even if they go to Sweden.

And then - and then - the Professor hasn't answered the phone for 24 hours. Gripping? So is duct tape. Except duct tape doesn't go on as long.

Whoever wrote this junk tries to cover themselves by randomly throwing in a car crash, or a Hispanic standoff, or a completely unconvincing love scene every ten minutes, so that people who can't get off the sofa in less than ten minutes have an excuse to stop trying.

I like trash TV as much as the next hombre but this is weak, derivative and not even fun. Anyone tells you it's 'unmissable' should be kept at 50m distance."
"How can this be over 8.0 rating?

Bad acting predictable plot silly illogical heist plan annoying characters with low intelligence. Real criminals have much higher intelligence.

Lost interest after S01E01."
"Money Heist - Flawed but Worthy (C+)

Just here to say Raquel has to be the WORST COP EVER. Within 80 hours of heist, she is galvanising with the stranger who has same similarities like the professor. Within hours knowing him, while dealing with the biggest robbery and kidnapping in the world she is bringing him to top secret places, family and then complains about why she can't find professor. Dumbest Cop EVERRR!!!

The show is definitely overhyped maybe due to quick money, sexual innuendoes and robbers being portrayed as hot shots. Show has portrayed police as imbecile, emotional and fools. There is not a good cop character for viewers to root for even though they're trying to do their jobs innocent getting raped, killed and all for money.

The show has it's moment but it's Fast and Furious of TV, nonsensical and stupidity is truly unrealistic. I stopped watching after season 3 episode 1, another heist geez who has the time for that and the smartest tech guy in the group gets caught due to tech thingy. It can't go dumber than this. I'm over and out!!!"
"I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
"La casa de papel started as a promising bold show. The first and second season had amusing and strong plot. Well defined characters and a storyline that could certainly catch your attention. The duel and chess between the protagonist and antagonist was surprising and full of ups and downs. Of course there were plot holes but you could overlook them in favor of the overall strength of story. The whole idea was bold and well developed, all and all, the ending was satisfying and well-written too.

But then came the third, forth and fifth seasons. The ones that Netflix actually created. The strong amazing plot turned into a cheesy foolish joke which was written by a class of third graders, and the smart kids weren't in the class!!

What a shame. There are so many problems with these seasons that I don't know where to even begin. Unnecessary flood of new characters whom you cannot relate to at all. The plot which was filled with surprises became totally predictable and utterly boring. You can watch a trick pulled again and again until it becomes a total cliche, but even then the writers won't let the worn out trick go away. Romance subplots are awful in these seasons. There are so many plot holes that you would wonder is it even possible to fit in any more? And as the plot gets more boring And flawed, writers just pour more gunfights into the story in hope of saving it, but it's a futile attempt, the gun fights are even worse than a bunch of stormtroopers trying to aim straight!

So please do your self a favor. Grab some popcorn, watch the first two seasons, but then forget that the rest of the show was produced. Save yourself a good memory of a great amusing TV series, which was ruined for us by watching the last three seasons."
"Biggest disappointment after 2, from the reason to do a hiest to a Alicia Sierra a pregnant woman portrayed as wonder woman .

She could only find the professor after being kicked out of force and that's not it able to capture a crew of 3 men one is military veteran.

Man the plot is full of holes like black hole it sucks your interest out."
"No matter how hard they try with the story, it's impossible to sit there and not burst out laughing or cringe at every scene with guns. They should just take as much of the shooting aspect out of this show as possible because nothing's funnier than seeing 10 people shoot with unlimited magazines/bullets and missing every single shot. I just can't take this show seriously."
"The first season was great, a solid 9. It was kind of a spin on Inside Man, my favorite Spike Lee movie (closely followed by Malcolm X).

But already in the second season the show metaphorically jumps the shark when a character literally jumps a motorcycle. Things quickly go south from there.

Season 2 had a natural ending. But of course Netflix has to keep beating that dead horse. Season 3 onward make no sense whatsoever.

Characters - who are now experienced bank robbers, mind you - keep making the dumbest decisions imaginable in order to fill the run time. The professor's planning skills were a stretch already back in the first season, but by season 3-4 he must have developed superpowers. Tertiary characters are thrown into the mix without introduction whenever they write themselves into a jam and the professor is so omniscient that it reminds me of another deus ex machina device, namely ""The Company"" from another ridiculous show that went on far too long, Prison Break.

The acting is for the most part over the top. Tokyo poses like she's on a runway, Denver is chewing the scenery whenever he's on the screen, and I hoped that we would finally be rid of a certain performer after season 2, but of course that performer is hamming it up again in plenty of dreadfully boring flashbacks in seasons 3-4 which seem to take up almost as much run time as the heist.

But the only thing more over the top than the music and the brain dead writing is the music, which is blaring at full speed constantly. A little tip to the composer: If everything is emphasized with dramatic music, in the end nothing is emphasized. Less is more.

The only reason I don't give this a lower score is because of the fantastic first and serviceable second season. Season 3-4 deserve no higher than a 3 rating."
Over-acting from every single idiotic character who all do idiotic things for reasons unfathomable to any normal functioning human on the face of the earth. I couldn't handle more than 3 episodes of the first season. That is a chunk of my life I'll never get back! Save yourself and avoid.
"A motley gang of criminals spend five months under the supervision of the hyper-annoying Professor, to learn how to pull off the heist of the millennium. If the premise sounds stupid, it's because it is. The Professor must possess infinite time and resources to select his gang, prepare the plan, organise the ""lessons"", rent a house in a secluded location, feed himself and the gang for months, etc...

But even if you buy it - for entertainment sake - all the ""careful preparation"" turns out as a mighty waste of time, because boys and girls on both sides of the law are too busy with their hormonal tempests.

All the four main female characters are engaged in illicit affairs and/or showing off plenty of flesh and lots of time is spent gazing at their buttocks. Discussing and carrying out intricate sexual cavortings soon derails the plot. Pregnancies are debated endlessly.

Within 24 hours from creating a hostage situation involving over 60 people, the criminals are privy to the affair of a married guy with his secretary and talk endlessly about that, like gossiping schoolgirls.

The stupidity of the dialogues is impressive.... Raquel, the lady detective in charge of negotiations, after having created a minor mess with the hostages, phones HER MUM, because she is terribly distressed, but they end up talking about a stranger Raquel is infatuated with.

I am not sure if the Raquel's role was a homage to female strength, but she actually succeed in being a massive stereotype of female irrationality and weakness. Could you imagine a male counterpart talking to mum about how hard his job is?

Finally, the whole plot is TOTALLY derivative: Tokyo is a bad copy of Mia, from Pulp Fiction; the criminals choosing fake names is copied from ""Reservoir Dogs""; the hostages being forced to wear overalls, from ""Inside man""... etc..

PS from the enthusiastic reviews of the audience, one would think the vast majority never watched a heist movie/series before..."
"The first series was intelligent, fun and full of surprises. The second series was as if a bunch of students were given a project to redo the entire series, got drunk or high, and produced this swill.

So much talking and terrible acting trying to evoke emotions but given the absolutely ridiculous plot and even worse dialogue. Fail!!!

Just awful!!"
"I've noticed a LOT, A LOT of the fake positive reviews mention breaking bad, that should tell you one thing. The plot sucks, you plan for months and you get this kiddy crap going on? Maybe I don't understand how stuff works in Europe, but a good show should make it seem somewhat real. There is nothing that feels real about the show. Gonna be in the building for days and yet they ""want"" a loose cannon on the team???? Not sure about the acting as I was listening in dubbed English, so can't say much about that. But the plot holes....... A well written show???? What???? Take a totally inept police force, and lucky as hell robbers, and you have this show."
"All my friends were talking about La Casa De Papel (I really don't get why you have to call it Money Heist) as it was the best series ever so I was really curious and excited to watch it. I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on."
"I wish there was a way to rate seasons separately in IMDb. The first season was great, a solid 9. But already in the second season the show metaphorically jumps the shark when a character literally jumps a motorcycle. Things quickly go south from there.

Season 2 had a natural ending. But of course Netflix has to keep beating that dead horse. Season 3 onward make no sense whatsoever. I thought season 4 was bad, but season 5 was bad on a whole other level. It's amazing how poor the writing and execution of this is in the latter seasons. The big firefight with the oh-so dangerous military A-Team sent in to wipe out the moronic robbers is shot so amateurishly that it actually made me laugh.

The characters - who are now experienced bank robbers - keep making the dumbest decisions imaginable in order to fill the run time. The professor's planning skills were a stretch already back in the first season, but by season 3 he must have developed superpowers. There is zero tension, because of course the professor will have thought of absolutely everything. Tertiary characters are thrown into the mix without introduction whenever they write themselves into a jam.

The acting is for the most part over the top. Tokyo (good riddance and I can see why she wanted out) poses like she's on a runway, Denver is chewing the scenery whenever he's on the screen, and I hoped that we would finally be rid Berlin after season 2, but of course Pedro Alonso is hamming it up again in plenty of dreadfully boring flashbacks which take up almost as much run time as the heist.

Leave it to Netflix to take something great and turn it into garbage.

Season 1 - 9 stars Season 2 - 7 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Season 4 - 2 stars Season 5 - 1 star."
"One of the many great series on Netflix depicts a group of people breaking into Spain's national mint. ""La casa de papel"" (""Money Heist"" in English) is a series that you just gotta see. Rapid-fire dialogue, clever editing, and all sorts of twists and turns make this one of the best shows out there."
"What a shame.

Why does a good series have to be lengthened, until it completely loses its identity? This last season, which no longer makes sense and where you no longer believe absolutely nothing of what happens, and neither do you mind you.. This is the last time I hope to get so bored with a serie.."
"Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!!"
"Don't waste your time with this show. I believe that someone from this show got on here and gave them a ton of high-level reviews. The show is so terrible that it does not make any sense that anyone would say it was good... It's a very weak story line and the voiceover choice of actors is awful. The acting is really bad, and I would guess you will never see any of these Spanish actors in anything UK or US based. You should do yourself a favor and watch ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" then watch an episode of this garbage and you will have gone from gold to trash.

A friend told me about this series... After about 3 episodes it was obvious that the writing was bad. It got worse and worse after each episode and felt like it was written for bored middle school kids with no imagination. The holes in the story are awful and the acting is bad. Every episode felt more like a daytime soap opera. The storyline got worse and worse with ridiculous outcomes. I read one of the reviews on IMDB and I laughed out loud with some of the stupid things the police could have done to end this boring kidnapping quickly! For example, ""Turn off the lights in the building"" - LOL

The main female actor and her role are ludicrous, and the script given to the mother is unbelievably bad. What is also bad is the music which reminds me of those terrible daytime soap operas. Can you imagine you walking into your house with some random guy you just met, and your mother asks you if you made love last night? Really! Well that si straight from the show - ugh. Terrible!"
The storyline is absolutely ridiculous. This moronic hash of a robbery of epic proportions wouldn't have lasted half an hour in the real world. I'm sure Spain must have some kind of special forces or an elite military response team that would have put this farce to bed in no time at all. The robbers were mostly brain dead and constantly ended up pointing guns at each other. Where did this 'professor' recruit them from ? Probably a Wetherspoons pub or a an agent who manages extremely bad actors.. People who believe in tooth fairies and Father Christmas will love this bilge. I'll give it 4 out of 863 billion.
"I gave up after 4-5episodes, it became really silly although I see the potential. But mainly the storylines of the people outside the bank are ridiculous. There is a big big robbery with hostages going on and the chief negotiator goes out every now and then to get a sandwich in a nearby bar? Where she meets the brain of the robbery? And can't leave her daughter with her ex because he's claimed to be violent, but can leave her with her dementing mother?...and when the ex takes the child (and brings it back after a few hours), again she leaves the scene of the robbery to solve a domestic issue? oh get real...

I found out I was fast-forwarding the episodes for the moments outside the bank. Could probably have been a nice movie, but as series too much silliness is added."
"I heard so much good about this series. Finally after years of recommendations from different people I decided to give it a try. And boy, what a mistake it was.Let me just say, that I created account here - only to write this review. I am that angry.

Let me start with the good things. First season started quite well as the basic premise is very good and intriguing - execute perfect plan and ""steal"" huge sum of money - but how they are going to do that? Character of the Professor was good as well. That is it. No really, that is is.

Let's go into the negatives. Almost every character besides Professor is annoying as hell. And it has nothing to do about them being ambiguous. They are just totally unlikable despite clear tries from the series creators. And I guess Tokio takes the prize in that department. Each time I saw her I wanted to skip this part of episode (which I did very often in Season 2), unfortunately she is our narrator... Serbs, Moscow and Berlin were not terrible as characters. The rest is just a joke.

After first season I contemplated whether I should continue. I decided to finish story and went into season 2. Who the hell wrote it? Again characters continue their completely stupid behavior - they go from one extreme to another in a span of one episode... , incredible situations happen, stupidity of decisions. Of course I did not expect this series to be accurate and true to life, but there are limits. In season 2 I was skipping entire sections out of boredom, anger and disbelieve - I just wanted it to see how it ends, and forget about it.

I will not watch season 3, 4 and 5. Enough of this torture.

This is just a poorly executed SOAP opera disguised as heist series, with terrible characters, totally unbelievable situations. What a waste of time. I still wonder how this is so highly rated."
"Writers are stretching story. In chaos, they acting more chaotic with their personal relationship & what entry Arturo Roman planned in season 4. Why to use copy who is having medical conditions. I felt bad for Spain people how they see this & is it military or police so dumb in Spain.....it's very boring by giving name money heist....you guys were showing daily soap relationship fights half of the time. & Freaking phyco people were plan to rob........."
"Season 1 and season 2 were 9/10 for me. However season 3 was meh and season 4 pretty meh except the two last episodes.Unfortunately, an other show netflix destroyed because of it's success.."
"It has some good and unexpected moments, but also lots of thin plot points. It's written in the usual millennial style: lengthen the thing again and again. And again.

But the worst aspect is watching the characters having relationships and often taking the dumbest possible decisions. I would like to say they are totally unrealistic, but it's worse, it's like watching the Big Brother on tv: a bunch of crazy, narcissistic and brainless guys, fu**ing, fighting and switching sides all the time.

Tokyo, Rio and Angel are extremely unlikeable, Nairobi and Denver almost are. Some of them are very badly acted. On the other hand, Berlin and Moscow are interesting and well acted characters. The Professor is just, well, the Professor."
"Rarely do I disagree with IMDB ratings in general but this show is not that good, maybe it's the really poor dubbing but the actors all seem far too emotional.

No one can speak a sentence without screaming or bursting into tears.

A bit of that is okay but after a few episodes I genuinely took a dislike to all of the main characters. Ep. 1 was good but as each episode unfolds the story just gets more ridiculous, no siege in the history of mankind has gone on for so long for so little, the plot is held together by hysterical outbursts from characters.

The female police inspector storms in and out of every scene not actually doing anything, at times I laughed out loud at her lines and reactions, in real life I think one of her co workers would have shot her, she creates more panic and threat than the bank robbers.

Too silly, too long, too much over acting."
"The core of the series revolves around several elements that are highly popular with viewers: action, romance, comedy, suspense, and even heartwarming moments that help sympathize with criminals. It is fair to say that the plot presents several moments of anguish throughout the different seasons, where the characters' character and loyalty to the group are tested. The creator of this series, which is based in the city of Madrid, Álex Pina, has managed to make the series live a natural progression, coming to offer in its last season something that has power, a little oxygen to the disturbing climate that lives in history."
"Nowhere near a 9. This show is a great example of when the netflix hype-train runs off the tracks and I will tell you why.

The two main female characters are supposed to be tough and assertive but both become stereotypical ""I have feelings too"" characters you so often see in generic tv/movies. In the case of the police officer, we are talking about a career defining case that will take at most a couple weeks. We're talking about a 24/7 hostage situation which she is solely responsible for. Meanwhile you have a very young child at home who has said she doesn't want to live with you anymore. This is infuriatingly unrealistic. Let's just say for the sake of argument that the character is 42, and that she won't be having any more kids. She is a single parent, her mom who lives with her has Alzheimer's and both her mom and daughter's safety are basically in jeopardy by leaving them unsupervised. Now add in the 24/7 hostage crisis, working (for argument sake) around 18 hours a day. Instead of going home and checking on both of the only loved ones in her life, she frequently goes to get coffee instead of going home. So far, ok, people do shit like this, I can understand. The thing that really crossed the line is that she not only neglects her home life, but willingly divulges unnecessary information to a complete stranger. Again, we are talking about maybe a few weeks of what is really going to either define your career, or ruin it. The few weeks that will decide if your daughter will ever see you again. This entire course of events just seemed forced and unrealistic. She practised no discretion whatsoever (how did she get to the position that she is in in such a field?), her judgment is along the lines of a drunk college girl - spending more time thinking about getting laid then being an adult.

The other main female character (the robber), portrays this stone cold vicious attitude, and while other characters also exhibit that, she seems to be ruthless. Guess again. The one person she loved was killed in front of her but that didn't seem to phase her. Her mother even turns her in, still nothing. So she gets involved in this seemingly too good to be true heist and all you have to do is be professional, and don't form inappropriate and personal relationships with your co-workers (which applies to literally any job). Again, ok we are all human she lost a loved one, had her mom flip on her etc. I could understand something like this if she fell in love, but nope. She certainly doesn't love the guy, and I can't imagine how she ever would. He is naive, and practices poor judgment, doesn't have the heart to do what needs to be done, is basically a liability. It just doesn't fit her character to A. act so unprofessionally, and B. risk everything for someone she isn't serious about. Same rules apply to the robber as the cop, we are talking a 24/7 heist, a couple weeks at most, a life-time of either glory, or ruin. And yet again we get the ""I have feelings too"" story-arch superseding an unfathomable amount of money. It just doesn't fit the character to jeopardize that, be a professional thief/robber, and exhibit this kind of behavior during such a critical small amount of time.

As you can see this is beginning to become a pattern, and we see it again with the professor to a lesser extent. Basically (aside from the tough exterior) he jeopardizes years of work to get laid. I won't go into detail on the professor, but he really isn't that smart, but neither are the police, so I guess that's okay. I am not sure how the police do things in Spain, but the level of fuck-ups just seems uncharacteristic. We're talking about rogue officers jeopardizing dozes of lives, lack of discretion, poor police-tactics specifically during the raid(s), poor judgment (how the fuck can you not sweep for bugs when the government is sitting in and you obviously have a mole), and on top of that just overall incompetence from everything to PR to gross mishandling of evidence handling. The other detective drinking and driving to such an extent because he is emotional. It is all just so unbelievable, again though I am not Spanish so maybe that is the level of competence that their police show.



As you can see, this is just the characters alone I have I outlined, and why I feel this show doesn't deserve to be rated as high as shows like Westworld, Mad Men, House of Cards, etc. It is actually rated higher than a few of those and just absolutely does not even belong in the same league.

The list goes on and I could make the case for other elements, other characters, etc. However, I will say that there are a lot of great things about this show. The plot is great, the 'idea' behind certain aspects of things like characters, methodology, behaviors, even things small things like the masks and fake gun rotation are excellent. The positives do outweigh the negatives, but not to the degree that warrants a near-perfect score.

The point of this review was not to bash the show, but to provide a more unbiased opinion (imo) because I experienced it in it's infancy with no real information available (I actually had trouble finding it on imdb). Also, because I feel that someone needs to speak up as the show has obviously been put on a pedestal because Netflix put their name on it.

I do recommend this show because on the surface it is something different, and has a lot of unique qualities. It is entertaining, but nowhere near perfect.

7/10 at most."
"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves. They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot. By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore. Season 3 was just a ""remake"" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a ""filler"" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing. Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."
"The breathy, awkward voices that represent the key players (professor especially) are TERRIBLE WEAK FARCICAL. The show could also have benefitted from better editing to help with the poor/hard to believe acting.

I know Spaniards, I lived in Spain. The men are generally macho and less than supportive of women beyond as tools. Fact not conjecture. But I have never heard Spanish men sound so weak vocally. Few normal voices, giggling instead of hearty laughter, among the men. The women were a bit better but it saddens me to see that since Franco's time, women are still treated/portrayed as weak and inferior or crazy.

I have repeatedly tried to watch Spanish shows but am beginning to think it's not worth it. Much prefer UK/Australian/NZ/Swiss/Norwegian/ American.

Look the concept is brilliant and that's why a 6 rating. But do something about your English dubbing! Try and you might gain a wider audience...if that matters."
Female inspectors is dumb . Robber keep coming front of her she don't use her brain. . Don't waste your time with this series I'm in season 1 episode 3 I'm already bored.
"Really disappointed in this fourth part of money heist. From Gandi being immune to bullets to just killing Nairobi in front of them. How did that even happened? I think Nairobi had some much more to her character and it was painful to see her fall.

But worst part was the script for professor, what happened to all his big smart plans? He just lost all his brain capacity just like that. Only good plan he had this season was the ""Pris plan"" but I wasn't satisfied with that. Why take her in their and what is there plan.

This whole season contained almost nothing about the actual heist, just about freeing Lisabon and a man that immune to bullets.

I think they did a season that was almost unnecessary, with only fillers in all the characters script. Was it just me that didn't feel like I was watching ""Money heist""?

Worst part was how they left us with a cliffhanger and how did she even get there with just a license plate. The real professor would never let a mistake like that happend.

Overall not worth about 1 year of hype for it."
"The first episodes are quite interesting, but then it's only background drama and a series of silly mistakes happening.

The plot turns out to be ridiculous and brainless... they plan a robbery for 6 months and they can't resist flirting for 48h.... And falling in love with each other. After 10 episodes you just wish they kill everyone."
"This is just an average series which is dragged dragged and dragged. After 2 episodes you will feel, why don't they end this soon. Could have finished the first 2 seasons in 2 hrs. Apart from Berlin, professor, all other characters act very bad."
Too much relationship storyline. I just really wanted a heist show. The premise was awesome but diluted to become a soap opera with a heist backdrop. Too bad

"I don't know if these positive reviews were paid for but I wouldn't be surprised. This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen in my entire life. I know there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief but his show requires you to but your brain in the trash bin while you watch this. Plan not using it all. The characters are so stupid and pathetic and one dimensional. It's sad to see Spain so influenced by the worst of american culture and movie making. El Tiempo Entre Costuras is a great show, much better than this crap if you want to see a good spanish series. I don't want to include spoilers because I truly want to warn as many people as possible from this horror show of stupidity. HUGE waste of time. The only thing that got me through it was knowing I was going to negatively review. The worst part about it is the ridiculous show doesn't wrap up at the end of the season. They are trying to stretch another season out of this pure garbage."
"It really started okay, but was way drug out. Season 1 was clever. After that, the flashbacks became annoying. The characters became unlikable. How many times do you need to pull guns on each other? Season 3 was a confusing cartoon. Heist was stupid and really made no sense at all. Watch it if you have the extra time but its not better than a 5."
"This series should have ended in season 2, season 3 and 4 totally unnecessary"
"I have never been more confused by a high rating for a show. Not a single part of it is well executed. The acting is not good, the writing is much much worse. None of the characters behave remotely like real people.... it's a mess. It's basically looney toons robbing a bank, but somehow very sad and excruciatingly boring."
"Emotions are swirling in my head like a whirlpool, I'm speechless.. my eyes are bright with flashes of lightning, I didn't expect that.. I've never dreamed of such a masterpiece on reading its merits and then watching its four golden seasons back to back.

But, here I am, shaken and in awe. That's not a series, it's a masterpiece, it's like a living dream, a roller coaster of thrills and emotions, so intense, so vivid that you keep on living the moments with the group, with the protagonists and antagonists alike, but foremost with the group of robbers, spearheaded by the amazing and terrific Professor.

Scene after scene, you come to root for them, to succeed, to make a difference, to try to change the system, to pass their message of resistance, like Robin Hood in modern times.


The cast was one of the brightest cast that I've ever seen. They didn't just play and perform. They were a family. The chemistry and camaraderie between them were just amazing and oh so believable. If I could, I would congratulate them in person with tearful eyes. I, especially loved El Profesor, Berlin, Nairobi and Stockholm... Do believe that every one of the actors and actresses just shone.
The screenplay, plots and sub-plots, cinematography and filming are worth tons of awards.
The music and soundtrack, especially Bella Ciao alone were just memorable, rightly placed and enthralling. Loved every bit.
The flow, development, pace and vibe of the show were near flawless, superb and super intense.


La Casa de Papel will be remembered as a blinding diamond for many many years to come. It is my opinion that It has set a new standard in TV shows, is a force to reckon with, while being truly unique and successful in its way of depiction and passing its message.

It's a series that grabs your attention at all times until you finish it as quickly as possible, makes you enthusiastic like never before and brings unbelievable amounts of joy, excitement and thrills to your viewing experience.

You will remember it for a long long time as one of the genre-defining TV shows of your existence."
"Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff. Stop before it's too late."
"Dull as dishwater .Crap acting and just not suspenseful ,whatsoever"
"Congratulations to the actors, director, writer and anyone who made this season of episodes possible. Every episode had it's gripping and human slow moments, such a wonderful balance. Couldn't wait to see the next episode. Each one had surprises, no standard script, which is so enjoyable. 
The actors played so well, better than many of the better known Hollywood names.
Hope the next season is coming up soon."
"I'm looking at the reviews and all I see is 3 stars 2 stars and I'm really confused, this show has it all. I never got bored and all the characters were really great ( all the robbers). If your looking for a show to watch this is definitely it.

Season 1 9.4/10 One of the best seasons of television. Really entertaining and loved all the characters. And they somehow made me feel sorry for the police in charge the robbers and the hostages ( except for Arturo. God I hate Arturo.)

*******SPOILERS********** Season 2 9.5/10 This show had the best ending a season could have and something you had waited 22 episodes for. Loved that Raquel and professor got together. And Berlin's death was really sad, and loved that basically everyone got out you could argue the show should've ended there but I'm quite glad they didn't.

Season 3 9.5/10 Do people not like this season? I loved it and thought it was a great comeback.

Season 4 7.8/10 I know a lot of people don't enjoy this season but I thought it was really good, definitely saw a downfall in this season but still enjoyed it.

Saddest death a Netflix show ever made (Nairobi), and I still can't believe this happened. I thought the ending was pretty crazy with Raquel managing to get in the bank. Overall this was a great season. And this is one of the best shows I've ever watched.

Can't wait for season 5."
"It started with a interesting premise. Printing one's own money, rather than stealing from people. The practical ramifications of printing that much money as shown(2 billion I think, I don't care) must be equally complex. But no one talks about that. Which would have made it a much more interesting show. Instead, we are introduced to some Morons who actually would be better off as Circus partners rather than robbers. Add to that , probably the Stupidest Chief Inspector in the Whole World with an equally stupid police force at her disposal and you get a La Casa De Papel.

People, We are in Grave danger, that being popularity is taken as a substitute for quality and creativity. This is happening at a unfathomable rate is all creative walks of life. The Avengers movies are a classic example for the case."
Yea what a waste of time. The professor has time to go on dates during a robbery? Sad series.
"See the reviews of other users - almost everyone is saying that it should have ended at season 2 and there was literally no need of unnecessary lame sequels, especially when season 2 had the perfect climax. 8 stars are for seasons 1 and 2 2 stars for season 3 and 4."
They made a disaster in season 4. My review was 10 before but after watching season 4 I changed it. Just awful and un logic action.
"This series started well and I at first gave it a solid 9! Then Netflix came along and decided to milk it for all it was worth and like all good series that it has gotten their greedy hands on ruined it.

The entire premise of this series was to create a heist with no victims! Season 3, 4 and 5 turned the series into a war against... capitalism??? The way that Spain and the Spanish government is a bit distorted and exaggerated. Seasons 4 and 5 was way over the top with people who never held a gun in their lives suddenly becoming commandos. It is sad how things turned out and I have a feeling that my 6 is going to turn into a 5 or a 4 by the time this is over."
"The plot gives us so many promises that it can not keep. Still better than average. However, cliché characters make it hard to watch wirhout feeling ashamed for the script writer. Some characters are well-built, but mostly stereotypical. It is supposed to be a smart robbery with smart thieves however i cant stop wondering why the proffesor picked those people specifically. Tokyo, for example, what is she really good for except supposed-to-be-sexy cliché monologues to intimidate certain someone or just wandering around, turning people on, making it all harder for the others. There are many flaws as such. But still watching it for the fun of it since it is hard to find clever scripts anymore. The show is thrilling enough to let myself be fooled on certain details."
I can't believe how can they screw it up SOOOOO BAAAAAD it was soo good !!!!
Total stupidity. Does this series shows that Spanish police are brainless and no capable ones are there!! Or is o only professor is the only intelligent person. Too much drama and facts are hard to digest!!
"Basically pick any character, with 7-8 leads, and do a 40min background on them. The viewers don't need to know what their 4th grade teacher gave them for homework in science class? It's annoying how greedy the producers got once they realized that they had a hit show and that it was popular. It does have it's good scenes but the first series is 16 episodes of 45 mins each, when it could have been done in 1/4 of that time.

Then they got even more greedy and decided on extending it with a Season 3,4 and 5. Unreal. What's next? Weddings,funerals, charity work and maybe one of the robbers becomes the leader of Spain. Nothing is impossible in this show !"
"Seasons 1 & 2 are not as bad as seasons 3 & 4. It's like a bunch of college kids decided to pull off a heist with their professor who apparently, is so intimidating with his flawless plan, that the police just give into all his demands. None of the criminals look convincing at all. Everyone in the show is just falling in love. There are some twists and turns in seasons 1 & 2 that don't make the show unbearable to watch but seasons 3 & 4 is a joke. Overall, it would make for a good soap opera but definitely not a good crime drama."
Why the high rates! This serie gets dummer and dummer.... Not worth my time..!
"Avoid this series unless you hate yourself and have time to waste. It is a mess, there's no way around it. From the absurd premise, to the clumsy execution and the mono-dimensional, stereotypical characters, there's little to nothing in terms of true enjoyment to be had. Every episode is just a series of contrived turn of events where every main character acts in the worst, most unintelligible way possible. There's no nuance, no real interesting psychological trait, every single character is encaged in a stereotype; everyone is annoying, bland, trivial, over melodramatic. And the story is even worse. Despite its desire to be seen as smart and clever, it's just so absurd and forced that the viewer is left speechless. The police are basically dummies, they play no significant role in how things turn out and if the protagonists weren't the most detached, oblivious, nonsensical fictional beings ever, the series would end after four episodes. Save yourself from this."
I'm not sure why this show is highly rated. Really disappointing. Had a good concept for a storyline but the it felt like it was directed in the 80s. Superficial dialogue and character relationships. Every opportunity to exploit the female characters is taken. Lots if man-handling and over sexualisation. It's all a bit cheap.
The story is tiringly repetitive Creativity was lost in the last 2 seasons because the story was complete but then netflix decided to order more Just let it be over It became junk-food television
"How is this garbage has 8.3 rating? Are you kidding me? laughable plot that doesn't make sense, trying so hard to make it intellectual but what a fail.

No character development at all, nothing, just some people fighting with guns and a little of stupid quotes to post on instagram. 6/10 at it's best."
How people rate this as a 10 is beyond me . A bunch of morons and a self loving so called professor hold up total useless police at every turn is as I say beyond stupid.
"I just finished binging both seasons, parts 1-4, and wow did this show hook me in right at the first episode.

Novice actors were cast and their performances were outstanding, falling sympathetic to each ones skills, flaws and unique personalities.

Directing was excellent, as was the cinematography. The story concept was brilliant, and played out with non-stop tension and suspense, and all the timelines and flashbacks were executed perfectly. Aside from some plot an technical issues, with a few pacing problems in some of the episodes - especially season 2, not a minute was wasted, and I found myself forgetting to breathe with the constant drama each episode offered.

Some people thought season 2 was bad, but it had its plus an minuses compared to the first season, which was stellar. The difference is more character development and dynamics, which I enjoyed, but I do agree about some of the long dragged out episodes, ridiculous and illogical action scenes, and overdone drama. However, season 3 episode 8 is one of the best episodes I've ever seen, of any show, or for that matter movie. It needs to win every award possible. I also was not a fan of the final episode of the second season. It didn't have a resolution like the first season, but instead, was left with many cliffhangers and illogical plot twists. They needed to have one or two more episodes to wrap up and give its viewers closure, instead of opening up a new season in the same heist. That was just dumb.

Nevertheless, it's the best international tv series I've seen, and in my top five of all time tv shows - right up there with Breaking Bad and Ozark. It's a well deserved 9.5 rounded up to 10/10 from me. Can't wait for part 5, and I hope it's sooner than later to relieve my frustration and anger how they closed out the last season. To see more of my 900+ reviews and 1000+ ratings, click on my username."
Seriously whats the fuss about??? The main characters start showing major flaws as soon as episode 3. Plot holes which make no sense. Silly actually!
"Seasons one and two are ok. Good character developing and good plot. The even deserve an 7-8 if you ask me.

But the continuation is a joke to all the viewers. Lame plot, lame character developing and disastrous storytelling. The voice-over from Tokyo is really annoying, and they try to make her a strong and brave character out of nowhere. She is obviously not that person. All along the series she showed what she is, a girl who only likes to have fun and not so much more.

Some of the characters are incoherent as they have fears of pity things but they can assault a bank with no problem.

Also, the entire series make an obviously apology to theft, showing it like ""justified"" and something good. A lame ""anti-system"" ideology in a millionaire Netflix series, the hypocrisy describes itself.

The season 3 and 4 are like a corpse with no soul, made only for making money, even the acting declined here. Things don't make sense, and the plot looks like it isn't thought anymore.

Some of the worst series that I've watched 1/10"
"The original ""Money Heist"" series was written and planned as a one-time thing, with the story arc of all characters' perfectly closed by the end of part two. The writers hardly held back with their choices, killed characters when the story needed it and you could feel the tension and danger as the events developed, because there was no need to keep people clean and alive for future seasons. With this second story arc, that forcefully brings the original gang together plus a couple of new additions, it's clear that the writers are trying to keep everything suspended for as long as possible. People always get this close to real danger, but almost nothing happens. The writers forgot that the characters are after all criminals if not terrorists, but they are now reincarnated as teenager idols with philosophic ideals against the dirty and corrupted authorities. All episodes are filled with soap opera nonsense, especially in a big portion of part 3. Part 4 gets slightly better even if the whole structure and dynamics are borrowed straight from the original season. They even found a way to have Arturo back as a hostage, which was like the most forced and stupid thing they could ever come up with. They know him well enough but still let him disrupt as usual. Palermo plays as the new unstable leader of the gang, and he even has yaoi side stories with multiple characters. Tokyo still holds the crown as the most stupid character ever, but I guess that she needs a bigger role because of her Instagram followers? No idea seriously. The first season was nothing deep nor groundbreaking, but the scale tipped towards the entertaining end of the show instead of the average teenager Netflix drama."
"I would love to give this series 9/10 if the series not stretched like a chewing gum, sweet in the beginning but now no juice remaining. It could be contained in one or maximum two seasons. I'm surprised at Spain police capability ,criminals are going in & out like a shopping mall & they are looking like a spectator, amazing!"
"Watched 2 seasons and it's just average. The ratings are very high. There is not much thrill. It's all about the professor at right place and right time. Professor has planned everything but forgot to dig the tunnel from hangar side even before heist started.

After few episodes it's just about love. Inspector in love with professor. Sub inspector in one way love with inspector. Hostage in love with robbers. Most of the robbers are concerned about their lovers more than money. Action scenes are just like movies. Heavy gunfighting without any death. Inspector comes to know the real identity of professor but then love truimps and professor escapes.

Cast wise Berlin was great. Professor comes next. All others are just average. Tokio, Rio , denver were worst and irritating characters."
"Seasons 1 & 2 were great and well worth a watch. I would easily give them a 9/10, they were so fast paced and full of tension, but most of all they were original and fun.

Since then, someone at Netflix has unfortunately cashed in and completely destroyed this show. Honestly, it's like watching a completely different programme. It's become a non-sensical, soap opera and how some of the characters are still allowed to make decisions is beyond me. I've written this review after season 3 and will not be watching season 4, I've got a feeling it's for the best!

I would absolutely recommend that you watch the first two seasons and forgot that they ever made anymore, it will not affect your enjoyment of the first two. Ruined by its own success, what a shame."
"Evenhough this is an enjoyable series at times, its a hard watch due to some illogically annoying characters. Specially the character narrating the story and the character who she is in love with. It became unbearable with the 3rd season. Should've ended with season 2."
"Before Netflix took it over, LCDP was a fun watch. It was extremely flawed, yet it was emotional, funny, and engaging

Once Netflix took it over, they pulled off their usual cheap selling tricks: Unnecessary, cheap, and non-serving sex and LGBT themes in order to appeal to some groups, politicizing the plot in a non-serving manner

Starting from Season 3, MH became so cheap, no real plot, unbearably fictitious dialogue, with impossibly amateurish twists

I wish I could have given it negative 130 stars."
Doesn't make any sense at all. It's rather a snooze fest
"This is so bad. A good idea, started with a lot of promise.

Why so much love and sex.

Too much style over content. I am at the last episode series one and I might not bother seeing the end.

Oh so much threat and no one ever gets killed. Is that a spoiler"
"No matter how silly it is, the action never stops. But I didn't always want new episodes to come, it should have ended where it ended in the Spanish version."
"After season 1 I won't be watching any more. I felt that it had the weakest storylines intertwined with poor story telling, patronising product placement (mainly of Spanish beer), and mundane sets & outfits. Not to mention the endless pointless non-functioning character development make this a huge miss for me - it was just uncomfortable to watch, but if you like Spanish soap operas it might be for you."
"What started off as a superbly intelligent and gripping drama series has slowly but surely fallen into the Holloywood trap of treating it's audience as if they are complete morons (sadly a growing market it seems).

If new to this, savour Seasons 1 and 2.

3 and 4 are OK, but by season 5, just take your brain outside and put a bullet in it before watching, there are plenty enough on offer.

Plot entirely replaced by countless hours of shootouts with literaly thousands of mostly non-lethal bullets fired, occassionally interspaced with drawn-out cutaways to superflous and mostly idiotic emotional drudge...... and that's about it !

Difficult to rate overall - 9 to the first two, and 2 for the last. So have gone with a 6."
S3 onwards is crude and incomprehensible rot. The whole thing is morally ambiguous but fun up to that point. But is then spoiled by nonsensical plotting and infantile crudity.
"This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this!"
Nothing more that a stupidity-meter device to measure the low level intelligence of population. And it works. 8.7/10!! Is this for real? Sic trasit gloria mundi.
"I used to love this series, but now i'm annoyed. Season 1 was great and kinda logical, season 2 was OK then it went really bad and illogical. Spent 8 hours watching season 4 and ended with BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and was total waste of time just to see how it's gonna end. Not gonna watch season 5 and will certainly delete the whole series from my top list.????"
"I'm currently hate watching season 4 of the series. If love geometry ( literally..triangles,squares) intrigues you..this might be the show for you..in case it's a thriller you want..all the okay scenes are already in the teasers and promos..so waste your time no further.

This show doesn't have potholes..rather the plotholes have coalesced to create some semblance of a story.

However here a few glaring plotholes from season 4:

1. 5 years..the governor and chief of security of the Bank of Spain and even the secretary remain the same..all have fixed terms.

2. Nairobi had braided hair when she was shot at the end of season 3..post her surgery ( by Drx. Tokyo of course) she now has straight hair and even some lipstick and the first thing she does after a near assassination..of course..romance with Bogota.

3.Gandia's blood falls for the first time in the library..when he was clearly leaking in the surgery room itself.

4. Even despite Arturito's repeated antics..no one can just tie him to a chair and gag him..he's left unsupervised like always.

5. Stockholm shot at cops in the first robbery..now she has issues with Denver's aggression when he is punching a guy she clearly knows is trying to manipulate Denver.

This is just for this part and episode..you can imagine how the rest of the show is like.

P.S : Showmakers..stop spoon feeding us and please cut the annoying narration of the show's worst character..Tokyo."
"I'm surprised to see this show is one of the highly rated. Here's my honest review. The idea of the story is good Cons:
Overdramatic: Every episode is 70 to 80% unnecessary time wasting scenes. Director fit forced drama in every scene
Wrost Actors: They casted pre-mature actors who you can clearly see that they are not skilled actors
Laugh of a guy called Denver will be the top annoying
English voice over of the professor is so weird
In 2nd season, inspector will uncover who is the professor, she arrests him but instead of telling anyone in Police or taking him to the station, she takes him to personal spot and make love and do a lie detection test even though he already accepted that he's the one who planned the heist, WTF is this drama man.


Conclusion: Avoid brain farts, watch something else."
"I haven't watched the rest of Money Heist seasons yet but the first season is just an absolute nonsense. And it's enough to see how easily and quickly the so-called police inspector Raquel Murillo giving up on the Professor's sketch, That was the most important thing in cracking the robbery investigation, And no one didn't even talk about it anymore, Including with the police sketch artist, who composed the Professor's sketch according to the description of the witness. Not to mention how this stupid inspector Raquel talks in front of everyone in the pub about the robbery investigation, And no less with a stranger she only just met, While she asks all the cops to get out of the room when she talking about the investigation with Angel, Who she didn't even bother to check if he don't have a microphone on him after he entered The Royal Mint Of Spain. How stupid can a police inspector can be? And she's the one in charge of the investigation of the biggest robbery in history..."
"The first 2 seasons, i would rate about an 8. Good story, nice characters, some powerful scenes.

3rd,4th and 5th seasons are not even mediocre. The new characters are unnecessary. Story is full of plot holes. Acting is extremely exaggerated. If i have to, i would rate them a 4.

So watch first 2 seasons and end it there."
"First of all, we should stop celebrating a crime. The professor & his team is nothing but a group of criminals. By loving the series, we are encouraging crime. If not, then tomorrow they will make series on terrorists and show them as warriors of Resistance.

About series, I think Tokyo is a pathetic character who is so selfish that while other gang members risk their lives for her, she always mess up the operation. She tries to look powerful but she is not. She is unstable and week. The makers should remove her from series.

I would love to see all them getting caught or killed in Season 5 and Police should win, because we love our country and our police. Not the criminals.

Right fellas?"
"I found the first season to be very ordinary and not as sensational as it's being made out to be.I couldn't understand why ""Tokio"" provided the voiceover as she had the loudest and most obnoxious and sickening character and as a result it was very difficult to relate to her when she was relating the incidents in a calm manner.The ""Professor"" was not smooth at all and this was a big let down as he was supposed to be very knowledgeable which he was and Zen like which he was not. There were also some sub plots in the 1st season which did not make any sense at all.My favourite character was ""Berlin"" Even the 2and season was quite ordinary with the ""Professor "" making lots of silly mistakes which was very unbecoming of a professional and experienced strategist. Once again in the 2nd season my favourite was "" Berlin""and to a lesser extent ""Moscow"" SEASON 3 IS A DISASTER and so not bothering to waste my time watching Season 4"
"Great series! Writing, acting, characters are on target. Crooks are both smart and dumb, like real criminals. You get to know the characters and come to like some from the start, like others early and then come to dislike them and two of them (for me) were never likeable (one a weasel, the other a bully). The plot twists and turns and leaves you wondering how this new problem will be resoved. Delightful.

I recommend against binge watching this. Watch an episode a day -- kind of like a wonderful piece of candy once a day -- it's a treat."
"Overly dramatic the sense that it doesn't care about the audience's intelligence. The acting is bad, soap opera bad. The music is overly everywhere in a way that it doesn't let you seep in the emotions but instead food spoons you. This like the transformers movies. Purely eye candy and entertainment with no substance and sadly, artistically no redeeming values. It's unfortunate that if this is what passes for good entertainment nowadays... tv will get worse in a sense with less substance, thinking, good execution and bad acting."
"Far-fetched, predictable, unrealistic, and really shabby acting.

The robbers are now going against each other, there's been at least 2 love stories all in the first 24 hours of a heist..

The fact that the robbers are now against each other and are lying to each other and going behind each others backs and trying to save the hostages is just so unrealistic and dramatic.

Now it's robbers vs robbers vs police vs love life drama #1 vs love life drama #2 vs hostages. Get in the bin."
"I LOVED the first two seasons... Watched the next 3 seasons wondering how they don't shoot themselves given the writers had them acting like morons.

Yes I did watch all of seasons 3-5 but only because I made a drinking game of it and every time the characters did something totally stupid I drank. Lets say I never finished an episode sober.

So buy a bottle or case of beer and enjoy."
"Girlfriends son wanted to watch this... We watched the first season and a couple episodes into the second..... This is supposed to be good TV? I could list about 10 things wrong, in each episode!! Sooooo many plot holes.... Is this supposed to be a dream team like oceans 11? It's awful, stupid, unrealistic at all, criminals are stupid, the police are even worse. Leaving hostages by themselves.... Personal relationships getting personal and in the way... Etc etc etc.... How is this even a show let alone highly rated?!????? Must have thousands of paid reviews, because this is garbage.... Maybe for a teen it's great because they haven't watched anything else....... Ever. Berlin is the only one that was watchable... The girl accidentally killed a man on one job, now she acts as she is a hardcore killer bada$$???? You got to be kidding me. Horrible horrible show... I rather watch battlefield earth a dozen times rather than watch 1 more episode of this garbage..."
"First of all, watching this series is only good if you need some adrenaline but even in that case, you need to keep skipping lots of lame scenes. Secondly, whoever made this tv show, must've watched too much hollywood and hollywood and also thinks he/she knows about psychology. But it is full of unnecessary events, stupidity and unrealistic scenes. Just for example; who in his right mind would even imagine that a boy who has been tortured for 2 months can handlenother heist? another one, Tokyo's character s unrealistically stupid because of impulsiveness, anger, insurgency and lack of any interporsonal skills. What kind of professor would hire a person who has thoughtlessly decided to visit her mom right after making a scene in that robbery which ended up getting her boyfriend killed? or that rio... what a joke his caracter was! nothing wrong with him if he wasnt picked up for a robby so big by a ""brilliant mind"", The Professor, who played around with all Spain. I gave up counting how many times they pointed guns at each other, how many times they were out of lines and stopped taking orders. I give 6/10 only because it pumped some adrenaline."
"Okay, we're just 4 episodes in, but I can contain myself no longer.

By the end of episode 1 I was beining to fear the worst. By the end of episode 2 I knew it was poor at best, but I'll admit to still being mildly intrigued.

We've just finished the fourth. It feels like I've dragged myself through at least double that number, with barely sufficient meat to warrant one episode. Its reminiscent of an 80s disaster movie, but with a two hour story being dragged out over 40.

Unfortunately my wife is still keen to see it through; I'd prefer to cut my losses right now. If I have to listen to one more clichéd, tragic character back story (or should I say sob story), I think I'll have to take a quick nap.

In the unlikely event it improves, and if I survive until the end, I'll return here to modify my rating. Don't hold your breath."
"Hard to see such a top rated series being so mediocre in its content. There seems to be no logic in the sequence of events. The chief inspector does a nice 9-6 Job, not bothered about the hostages. Goes home nicely when she feels tired , dates her so called boyfriend. I really like the part played by hostages. They enjoy themselves being in captivity. No one bothered to break free. Thought they make some attempts , but ultimately enjoy themselves being called hostages. Also the robbers have their nice Team meeting every now and then , without being bothered about the hostages that they may run or hurt any of them. Liked the trust factor that was built betweent the two parties. And lastly they buillt a nice tunnel between the Royal Mint and the professors house. The distance seemed to be less than 5 meters. EXCELLENT JOB REVIEWING AUDIENCE!!!"
"Great story, directing and fantastic acting. You cannot stop watching!"
"If there is a spanish TV Show you can't miss, so its definitly this one. It gets you into finishing an episode after the other. Totally recommend it, can't wait to see whats coming in season 3."
Can't believe everybody is watching this soap opera with guns. It seems the stupid little stories will be going forever. All I can see is some underlining neo Marxism making it appealing to the left wing uprising all over Europe.
"We have a great premise here but it is utterly ruined by characters doing dumb things constantly. They train for five months then do everything they were told not to from the get go? It's one thing if things go wrong, and you expect that, otherwise there's no conflict and no interest in a story. But when it's characters doing dumb things, it gets annoying fast. Anyway, it's a decent show but the characters will piss you off pretty quick."
"Considering this show's rating and recommendations from friends, I was expecting a good show. In reality, it's below average.

The good things are the visuals and their main plan to print money rather than steal existing money.

The masks are just knock offs of V for Vendetta. The code names and rules scene is straight out of Reservoir Dogs. So what's new? You have specialists like Oceans 11, except here, they are all immature morons that you wonder why the ""genius"" professor picked them. Tokyo and the main detective are unbearably annoying and the way the plot move is ridiculous.

A ridiculous plot would be fine if the show leaned into with a funny tone like Guardians of the Galaxy, but this show takes itself so seriously as if it is Breaking Bad and you roll your eyes.

In the first episode, when the show thinks it is at its most epic, the narrator says, ""We went through this plan 30 times. We shoot near the police...but the professor never said...the police would shoot back""...SERIOUSLY?

That's another thing, narrating/voice over is the laziest kind of writing. It's always better to SHOW not constantly TELL.

Being over an 8/10 is really over rating this thing."
"They try to make the story so great that its just absurd now. I had to stop at season 4 ep 5 to write this.. That gun fight scene... WOW. Its like a seven year old wrote the scene. Was he on a bullet bending drug to escape that??? People give this too much credit probably for the intensity a heist creates, eventhough the movie has pointless twists all over."
"Spanish police should take actions against the creators who just joked on them till season 5 and this so called ""RESISTANCE "" and their logic of not robbing money from people instead of printing that is dumbest argument in world - my friend suggested this show and I must tell you if you watched real quality drama and other things , you must ignore this or you'll lose faith from netflix , DUMBEST DIRECTION AND STORYLINE WAS GOOD BUT IN SEASON 1 IT WAS OVER BUT THEY WERE JUST PASSING TIME , Professor was only a joker from my point of view not GENIUS."
I am very happy that i watched it and i have already recommended it. But the reason i have rated it 8 and not 10 since i ideally think this is a masterpiece keeping in mind the intelligence behind the series. Every detail was figured correctly and the screenplay was apt too. However there are illogical stuffs added which i think takes the charm away but its okay .. they are much avoidable and it doesnt really hamper your exprerience though since its after all cinema so dont apply much brains to a few scenes. PS - loved the background scores
"Strong points are the cast and the ingenious plotting. But after the first few episodes it starts to drag and but episode 10 you're into ""sunk cost fallacy"" - I've spent 10 hours of my life on this series so it make sense to see it through to the end.

But doing so and you have to endure the most absurd plot holes and character behaviour. The lead cop takes off for the evening and leaves her mobile phone off for 24 hours whilst the siege reaches a climax; snipers are ordered to shoot one of the gang on the roof but only fire one shot, allowing the gang member (hostage in a mask) to live; hostages blow a hole in the wall and escape but the police, apparently having no snipers to fell the villains, nor flash-bangs to subdue them, fail to enter the building, thereby prolonging the siege. ""Alison Parker, daughter of the British Ambassador"" does not appear to have been anywhere near Britain.

All very silly and just moderately entertaining."
"Great idea, but why did they stretch it out so long. After season 2 I'm out. Some good acting and some awful. Every time Arturo was on screen I hoped he'd get killed off, awful. The interwoven plot is clever but ridiculous. Shame it could've been great."
"It starts with a good plot, but in season 1 and 2, the pace is so slow, it really feels like the writer is stretching the story too much with drama. This series could be the best action series of all time, but they choose to bend it to a mini telenovela with overstretched drama.

I have to fair, there are great moments, cool actions, chilling plot, but there are also useless conversations, stupid logic and maybe one of the worst: very very unrealistic shooting choreography. Example how can Gandia escape from 6 shooters with assault rifles from a short range? What happen when the first show down when Palermo hurt his eyes, and nobody else gets a single wound? You guys should really hire a better choreographer, no need a John Woo level, but a least not this STUPID.

The figure Arturo is so cheap, maybe intriguing at first season. But the writer keeps him in season 3 and 4 just to make the audience has someone to hate. In season 3 and 4, the pace is so much better than the season 1 and 2. But additional to Arturo, here comes Sierra. An unrealistic figure who was created just to made the audience boils.

For acting, i have to give Berlin a extra credit for an outstanding performance. Else from him, i have to say: mostly poor performance. Even the Professor. Even Tokyo."
Season 4 total disappointment. The whole seasom can be compleed in 2 episodes and but extended like a rubber band. Boring. Not watching season 5.
Seasons 3-5 are sort of a 2.0 version of seasons 1 and 2. Totally unnecessary. It looks like a repeat made with a bigger budget. Regrettable how entertainment companies work. Aside from the endless slurs and sausage stuffing of totally uninteresting and unnecessary novels. Good thing just some raw action scenes that we've seen in several other movies as well.
"I am very dissapointed of season 4. Nothing happened though all of the Episode except that Raquel Was release in a very unrealsitic way. They found an Helikopter Just like that and got away with it. And the pilot of the helikopet knows 50 foreign languages and how to drive an Helikopter. :D Another rediculous fact is that the pregnant detective is such a Genius that she could find Just in 5 five the Professor. Sorry, I prefer to watch Spiderman. It's more realistic and interesting."
"Season 1 and 2 were great, solid 9/10, but the last two just destroyed it. Plotholes everywhere, most of the characters actions don't make sense, stupid new characters, totally unrealistic crap happening all the time, the professor seems to know everything, his pakistani hackers are straight out of a bad hollywood hacker movie, the dialogue makes you go mad because its so stupid and there are way too many throwbacks. Also, the whole thing is way too long and just gets boring, this could easily be a 3 hours long movie.

Another thing that's just ridiculously stupid is Julia or Juanito, the new undercover hostage. First of all, who needed a trans person in this series? it doesn't even contribute to the plot, Netflix just put her in because of money and good reputation. Then secondly, the ""trans person"" Julia isn't even played by a real trans woman. ridiculous!

Take my advice and watch Seasons 1 and 2, leave the rest out."
"Loved the series, actors were perfect fit for each role and they make you root for them. It both has drama from the heist and romantic part to it. In my opinion season 3 and 4 didn't meet the expectations after the first two. It feels kinda forced because everybody was so obsessed when it came out on Netflix that it kills all the good from the first two seasons. If you can watch the first two season and you will end up loving it to the top."
"Once You Start Watching This, You will stick to the screen. Each character is memorable. Berlin, Professor and Tamayo are awesome and that blowing away that tank in end of the third season is great."
"This must be one of the best series I've seen lately. It is so thrilling and unpredictable in every single episode, that you have no idea how it will end."
"This series is total garbage, it should end by four episodes but no they decided to make money not by heist but by producing its four seasons and that's the heist yeah Characters are so dumb and stupid, and not to forget how it got stretched, horrible decision to watch it I need to donate my eyes now"
"Despite some of the more ridiculous contrivances, I appreciate how suspenseful and entertaining this series can be, and being able to keep that up through the series as well as La Casa de Papel is a great feat. Even better, they managed to wrap it all up with a satisfying ending that... what... there is gonna be a series 3?

Viewed in Spanish language with subtitles."
"This show is highly overrated. It started out trying to be very clever, but devolved eventually into a driveling mess where the same type of drama is repeated way too many times in different fashion.

My biggest issue is that I find every single character in this series to be despicable lowlifes. That fact makes it difficult to watch, as it very quickly becomes irrelevant to me which side wins or loses.

To those that disagree. Please analyze the actions of each character, and ask yourself what the REAL consequences of those actions are. If every person on earth acted in the exact same way, what would happen? Well... nothing good.

It doesn't help that the writing jump sharks, battle is over the top unrealistic, modern real-life tactics nowhere to be found, soap-opera drama between the main characters, and a synthetic and highly crafted script trying too hard to prop up bad people and make them heroes, when they clearly are not.

While all people are scum here, some are hilariously evil to the point that it's just laughable. The writers set up unrealistic scenarios to wash their hands of evil actions performed by someone else, but it doesn't absolve them nevertheless.

The politics of this show is shoved in your face so violently that is impossible to miss. Great for those that lean that way, but not for the rest of us.

To the next team trying to create a clever ""heist"" show, remember this: As soon as someone hurts someone else either physically or emotionally, they ARE the bad guys no matter what you are desperately trying to convey to the audience. If they continue doing the same stuff over and over again, it's even worse."
"I heard all of my friends say that I needed to see ""La Casa de Papel"". So I thought I'd give it a try. I liked the show in general, but it is so unrealistic at times. If you love over the top action movies or just another crime series then this one is for you. But definitely do not expect ""the best series ever"". It's a DECENT series and I would give it a 6/10. 
Entertaining for once, but not gonna watch or recommend this series again."
"More repetitive than garlic! Rio was tortured for the first episodes, if you watch seasons 3 & 4, you'll be too... Honestly I've only watched until the end just for curiosity, spare yourself and choose anything else to kill the time during the quarantine."
"Every episode worth ever minutes of your life, your life wouldn't be complete if you miss out this show such an iconic series of all time, wish they extended some movies but overall I'm satisfied with the ending, very well!"
"Part 1 of the series was amazing. The story twisted and turned so unexpectedly that I gave the writers lots of credits. The robbers seemed to have the upper hand very steps of the way. Each of the robbers has his/her interesting characters and I like them all.

But the story took a dramatic turn toward weirdness in Part 2. Maybe the writers ran out of good ideas and the bad ones started to come out.

**** Spoiler Alert *****

I was never a fan of Raquel but I do understand people get manipulated emotional, especially someone as good as The Professor. But for someone at her level, leading the crisis management team would do something so reckless to kidnapped The Professor. Why? Because you slept with him? Then, got overpowered (surprised) and eventually turned to the robbers' side. WTF. Then, go back and lied to his colleagues on the police side. WTF*2? With all that, they just let her walk away.

Some people has the stereotype (and I don't buy it) that ""women are too emotional to make the tough things"". Well this story fed directly into that wrong stereotype. If that is who she is, she should have and could have never gotten to her position. Something doesn't add up.

Now, back to the heist plan. If The Professor has it all figured out, was flirting with the inspector part of the plan? What if the inspector was a guy? What if the inspector wasn't desperate for love? Would everything fall apart then?

I give up and not continuing to Part 3."
"We've only watched the first 2.5 episodes of S1, but it looks like that's going to be it. The premise promises a thrilling caper type series, but it's just not that. It's more melodrama and bungling, which isn't what we signed up for or intriguing. We just don't care about any of these characters or believe they could pull off such a heist.

Her Take: I feel baited and switched. I hate that.

His Take: Too many scenes feel like they were included just because someone wanted to film them. It makes the plot disjointed, unengaging and unbelievable."
"Almost everything about this show is awful. Who on earth did the casting? Most of this gang cannot act. The worst example is the son of that bearded guy. Cringe over cringe. He can't even fake laugh. Giggles like a toddler the whole time so much that you wish he is going to be first one to get shot to take him out of his misery. All the pretended coolness is so cringeworthy. The ridiculous ""Pulp Fiction""-style discussion over the masks in the back of the truck almost made me burn down my house with fire.

The gang leader wants to make you puke particularly in the scene where the hostages are lined and he goes from one to the next and whispering them cringe into their ears. Trying to be so cool, but nope, he is not. Ughh. According to the trailer, it is revealed that nobody takes him serious anyway. Then the scene where the bearded guy ""cracks"" the 60cm thick main safe door with a simple blow torch. LOL. He cuts through a surprising only 1cm ""thick"" metal cover like through butter and then pops it open with an off the shelf screwdriver in under 5 minutes - what a joke. Really? The Spanish National Mint's main safe is that easy to open? Have these people never watched other movies to see how it's done? And all this time they are so adamant about being incognito - except 3 of them being unmasked for most of the time. And the hacker dude - clickety-click - fist pump, hacked the whole system with a GUI using Visual Basic. And forget about a one night stand - our ""Little Lamb"" seems to be after a one hour stand. The scene with the selfie is unreal. It's her phone - why is she panicking? And how does that dude think the photos will go viral - photos are still on her phone! The main character in search of ""Little Lamb"" is literally checking every executive room (rooms where teenagers would never dare to enter to make out) except the most logical places - the goddamn bathrooms! So many movie mistakes in 1 single episode. The big hairy brother dudes were introduced as the only weapon experts, yet everyone is running around like Rambo. Not a single scene was shown what in those 5 months has happened. Not a single scene showing the crew being trained in how to use a weapon. Alas the sad scenes where they shoot like in a cartoon. Spray and pray, I guess. Although, apparently the love birds had sex every day in those 5 months. In those 5 months there wasn't even a proper briefing by the ""Professor"". It is a miracle how he tracked down the main character. Not only tracked down but took those surveillance photos of her granny's house and then promptly drove to her to recruit her. How the hell did he know which public phone booth she was using? The list goes on and on. And this was only episode 1.

All those 10/10 reviews must be Spaniards who are voting purely out of patriotism or have never seen a good show/movie before. I could barely finish episode 1. I had no more cringe-energy left towards the end. I should have known better because the trailer alone gave hints about the cringe-levels of this abomination.

You want to watch a proper recent heist movie? Watch Army of Thieves. There are many many examples out there."
"Oh, common. This is more like a money heist perpetrated by the LOST producers. You are in the final episode and the turbine of the plane that crashed in the first episode is still spinning. Common. I don't get the hype over this. Try it, if you like, you are with the majority. I tried 4 times and this won't work for me."
"Overrated. The first two seasons trundle along and are entertaining enough. The third season starts off well, but by the time they get to their second heist, it's all turned to mush, with a score that begins to get irritating because it feels like they're just showcasing songs, and drawn-out love scenes that make you want to puke. I couldn't take any more than S3E7."
Maybe for viewers that just started watching films and TV Shows.
Stop hyping show you morons. There is nothing special about it. Stupid people!
"Another typical example of a series starting out really good but that just doesn't know when to stop. That point was the finale of season 2. At that point I rated the series an 8 and it would have left a good memory for me. However it went on with season 3, 4 and now 5 and just got worse and worse. I also got super allergic to the hyped-up scenes where someone looks like some badass superhero and finishes it with cringy one-liners. The cliché and cringe visions of the creators were forgiven because it had a clever story for the first two seasons. However, from season 3 on, hyped up cringe and cliché is all that remains and it just becomes kind of a drag to watch."
"This is the most overrated show i have ever seen, the downhill is so hard that it hurt me psychologically. The romance is very bad and stupid with no sense plot. The characters in the beginning seem to be very pro and you can find later that they are a bunch of amateurs, they will make you hate the characters instead of develop them, the insteresting ones...well... you will see the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think ""damn nice..."" the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails. its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show."
"In my opinion this is the best tv show i had watch (beside 24), i finished all 5 season in just 2 days.. i don't know why so many critic for this series, my point is if you looking for entertaint, then get rid of logic, just enjoy and watch this (i watch the original without dubbing), and you will get a good fast paced story and adrenaline pumping tv show, isn't that what movies do.. to provide entertaint? Can you say Starwars logic? Jurassic Park? Games Of Thrones? How about Marvel or Dc movies? Even autobiography or historical movies not always tells 100% accurate story

But if you want somethings that tells logic, just watch discovery channel."
"Show seemed clever enough at first, but the quality went down over time, to the point that season 5 had none of the good parts of the first seasons left, it was just a soap opera with unnecessary screaming and drama and flashbacks, and no more believable plot twists left, and no more reason to root for the thieves left either. It got unwatchable by the end, basically.

Can't recommend the whole thing, just watch the first 2 seasons and then stop wasting your time. The ending doesn't make it all worth it, they just kept making unnecessary seasons for the profit (which is ironic, considering how one of the early attractions was its robinhood-esque element).

Happy it's finally over so I don't have to hear any more undeserved hype about it every time a new season starts."
"It started off good, but then everything gets soooooo STUPID. I should go into fortune telling with all the stuff I called out from the get go. NOT GOOD. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. Anyone who says otherwise is an IDIOT."
"Sure, the idea of the show is smart and entertaining: a bunch of elite criminals working together to rob billions of dollars. Some of the characters such as Berlin are professional and smart, which is good for the plot. It could have been a great series. But the show went downhill after Tokyo's relation with Rio is introduced. Their love is not reasonable at all and Tokyo kept using love as an excuse to ruin the plan of the entire team, putting everyone in danger but did not pay for her mistakes. Besides, there are just so many plot holes in the show that I don't want to spoil here. The police are unbelievably dumb and useless as they dealt with the criminals in stupid and inefficient ways. Many of the characters in the show does not help develop the plot but just annoy the audience so much, one of them being Tokyo who is so immature and arrogant which kept bringing trouble to the whole team. The actions of some characters are brainless and the show simply doesn't deserve such a positive rating. I would have given it a better rating if not for the vexing characters and plot holes. The show is polluted by undeveloped and sudden emotions and love between the characters."
How could professor made a robbery with some noob and unstable people except berlin.All the problem occurs by rio and Tokyo's false love.whole series was gone downhill by these couples.please remove rio and Tokyo character on next season it would be better.
"I really don't know WHY this show is so popular and so high rated. Truly, makes no sense...

...The plot in ANY season is ridiculous. A group of AMATEUR or SMALL EXPERIENCE thieves, are involved in IMPOSSIBLE roberies. Okay, ""El Profesor"" is the genious guy, the clever man, he designs incredible plans to succeed. But, even so, even if you do have incredible plan, the task is not less IMPOSSIBLE - those kind of roberies.

Okay... ""I'm buy it""... in the 1st & 2nd seasons, lets say this robery COULD BE DONE (in real life it would be impossible too, but lets say is the MOST ""MAYBE"" scenario), altough if in the 2nd season we have IMPOSSIBLE resques and other things.

But okay... ""I'm buy it"".

And then... when the show SHOULD BE ENDED... because it has fans and making money... they ""found"" a SUPER-RIDICOLOUS & NAIVE story to continue it.

The gang, ALL MILLIONERS, having our dreams' lives... and then RIO it makes a STUPID thing and getting arrested. Because of that... TOKIO's ""forcing"" their leader (""El Profesor"") to make a plan to resque him... ...and ""El Profesor"" launching A 1000% TIMES MUCH MORE IMPOSSIBLE ROBERY PLAN than the first original one! All that... just to resque RIO.

And when they finaly done this, they keep staying in the bank with HALF SPANISH ARMY & THE ENTIRE POLICE all around them, surrounding them!

No killing... no hostages' executioning... no killing the rioting prisoners... nothing (just before the 2 last episodes of the 5th season)!

These are the MOST GOOD ""BOY-SCOUT"" robers in the entire history... armed like ""Rambo""... but NOBODY's killing anyone!

Seriously, fellas... the SCENARIOS of those seasons (even the first two) are like they've been written by 9 years old kids!

SUPER SILLY scenarios!

I like the REALISTIC stories.

I like stories, films, movies that they have REALISTIC scenarios and making wonder ""hey, could that be true, based on actual events?""

So, ""Casa de Papel"" is a SUPER ""FICTION"" REALLY NAIVE story. Yes, full of action, drama, emotions, but... NOT A BIT realistic."
This series should be ended in seasson 2.. please stop
Everything in this show is just obvious. every character in this show is acting stupid! you cant connect with anyone. i really wonder why a lot of people like this show.
"My Spanish husband was keen for me to watch this but after the first episode I was convinced that this was a show that would be full of cliché after cliché. I would like to ask the writers whether you intend for the audience to take this show seriously or is it a bad take on the 17th century picaresque narrative? Have you ever heard of showing not telling? I suppose in order to compensate for the general lack of talented actors you have to resort to force feeding us their motives and reactions. In the 21st century audiences have come to expect characters who are various shades of grey, not black and white cartoons of good guys and bad guys. I know the police in Spain are not that incompetent so who are you writing for? Is it some type of social commentary? The women in Spain are also not overly emotional who crumble under pressure (To the point where they call their mother from the back of an ambulance). What is the point of a character like Alison (Eye candy)? And don't get me started on Monica (she has some type of personality disorder). Both are cringe worthy. Rio rats out his fellow thieves because things don't go his way and there are no consequences. Tokyo ruins everything and yet she is welcome back with open arms which is ridiculous story telling. This show is written like a bad fan fiction full of Mary Sues. Don't stick a Dali mask on the show and expect us to believe it is art."
"I was very excited to watch ""Money Heist"" after seeing all the great reviews for it. I was very unimpressed. The show is virtually a 70 hour long heist. Parts 3 & 4 are essentially the same story as parts 1 & 2. I was hoping that by the end of part 2 we were done with the hostages & robbery, but no...It just started all over again but robbing a different target. It was painful to watch.

Now, the flawed story-line aside, the writing was crap. The police protocols were HIGHLY unrealistic. No police in any developed nation conduct themselves this way. ie, shooting into a group of hostages in disguises because you ""assume"" that the one you're aiming at is the bad guy--The entire show is filled with ridiculous policing like this. It was terrible.

I wish I could get my time back."
This show is so much overrated and european people are making so much hype of this show
"Seriously...this program have a score of 8,4 ?? Really ?? ....Money heist its a show for kids of 14 years old , with a stupid script ,with forced situations, with even more forced reactions and overacted characters ..... a dissapointing frankenstein made for teenangers and people with bad taste in shows."
"The first 2 seasons were great then it started to lose the attractiveness of the characters. Season 5 feels like a cheap of the shelf production.

It lost all smartness that we were expecting."
"Improbable story, head police lady wore blouse showing half her assets, makes love to bad guy not knowing he was bad guy, voice over woman was reading from printed page at all times and in general the whole darn show just stunk but I watched it anyway. I learned a good lesson for future Netflix series/movies. It I think they stink, quite watching. Thanks for education, NetFlix. I love you anyway."
"I already reviewed this amazing show a year ago.

After a year, I return and again see the hatred towards the alleged HYPE that many viewers out there feel about La Casa de Papel.

To all lovers and haters, please know, that's the only series that I would give a 100 if I could.

It is that great, that amazing and that impactful.

Happy binge-watching the first part of season 5 in September!"
"Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent series. It has a total of 999 minutes, which is like watching a movie 16,6 hours long. Many scenes were obviously ""stretched"" to fill in time. If it was a normal movie it would be trimmed down to 2,5 hours the most. Putting that aside, the scenario was partly taken from the Inside Man (2006), but with many more twists to the story. I still think the scenario was excellent and well played out.

One of the best series up-to-date that I have seen, and I have seen many. This is a ""must see"" movie and worth your time. It was so good that I hope they do NOT make another episode.

Special thanks to Álex Pina!"
"How much do you get paid to give this a high rating because I could use a few extra bucks? 10 minutes in I knew this was garbage. A thief has her face plastered all over the news and she decides it was a good time to go visit her mother??? This was obviously written for someone who has never saw a show about crime or better yet a show at all. I refuse to list everything that's wrong with this show because that would basically be everything but I have to comment on a few laughable moments. I mean come on, the inspector has time to go on dates in the middle of a heist, pregnant hostages are willing to have sex and fall in love with robbers they knew for all but 30 seconds and lets not forget the professor aka the psychic. Even if he was planning this heist for 5 years he could not have thought of every possible conrtingency. Some say to leave your brains at the door when you watch this, I say dont even open the door you'll never get those hours of your life back."
"I am almost through the 3rd series and can honestly say there had not been a moment where I haven't been immensely entertained and enthralled.

Fantastic characters set in really smart plots and great cinematography. Slick made for TV series that would do well on the big screen except that I wouldn't want to cut a minute!

Watch in the original soundtrack you avoid it sounding corny!!!

Just love it!!!"
This show is so much illogical and people are following it blindly from begining to the end i have never seen logic in this series
"I tried several times now. I didn't even read any reviews before so my opinion is souly my own. What the hell happened to this series? It's SO bad and over dramatic. It used to be a smart show and now it's like they hired indian soap-opera writers for the season 4 script. I loved this series but I can't get through this season. 3 episodes in and I'm just gonna stop watching now. It was a fun ride while it lasted.

PS. Whoever made the music for this season should never get a job again. The music is SO overdramatic most of the time. Playing heroic soundtracks while people are just talking. Like do they not have any sense of music and ambience when it comes to film? Jesus christ dude..."
"What made the original series so great was lost on S3 and 4. The genial and calculated plans by The Professor have been traded for emotinally irrational and borderline idiotic actions by protagonists. Moments of wonder and amusement by the well-made plans are gone, now replaced by fury and anger how the hell have they even survived this long. Perfection is now chaos. More entertaining? Not for me."
"These guys call themselves revolutionaries, but all they did is to rob banks and live a luxurious life with the money they stole from state, Real REVOLUTIONARIES are people who put their life at risk for the opposed and poor, these guys are not revolutionaries, they are just murderers and bank robbers. And this show is just over glorification of crime and bank robbers"
The show implies that they are very smart but they spend the time proving that they are really really really dumb. All this to create tension. It could have been so good but they managed to make it annoyn
Overrated apart from some scenes with professor do you really think thieves are that dumb?
"Plot is so stupid and unlikely, wasted a couple of hours I will never get back......"
"This series got a high rating. So I thought let's check it out. My god how the hell people are even liking it! It is so overrated. Here are few points I picked up from first 7 episodes. 1) Professor makes the stealing looks like a heroic act. I mean how. They are not stealing but printing money, so what is that, charity!!! 2) The guys involved in the heist are so stupid. Two of them fell in love & now their love is more important than their mission. One father who spent most of his life in prison got panick attack knowing his son has murdered a hostage and almost compromised their mission. The son who is a 'hotshot' and used to 'bully people' fell in love with a hostage and could not kill her. (Yeah that's how the poor their writting is). It's nothing wrong for a criminal to have a heart but they have it too much, you will feel they are too good to be a criminal (but none of them are amateurs). 3) The police. They are the stupidest people I know. An inspector shares her mission information with her mother. She goes home & comes back like you are in a 9-5 job. She even dates during the mission. They let any people enter in their camp, no privacy at all. Even I could have fooled them. Don't even talk about the acting and voice-overs. Apart from one or two people the acting is aweful. Please stay away from this show."
"Season 3 and season 4 were the most unnecessary seasons in the history of TV. Everything was either repeated or badly executed. Replacing characters with - guess what- a copycat of that character. And on top of all an ill explanation for the whole thing.

I had rated this show 7/10 after season 2. Now it deserves a 1/10 only because zeroes are not allowed here."
It sounded promising but after just a few episodes it lost it. Everything about this is very bad. Don't wast your time. I'm hate watching it just because my ocd won't let me stop.
"I have absolutely no idea how this series can have a rating of 8.5/10. The whole of Spain must have rated it so high...or Netflix paid some critics... It is senseless and let itself get lost. A professor assembles a crew to pull of a daring and most improbable heist. He is suppose to have gotten the best in the business, but judging from what is happening; it looks like he got them at an AA meeting. These guys must be the worst criminals ever...or maybe that's the standard in Spain. Anyway,if this is what Netflix calls a hit,then we are in for a big ride!!!"
Fast paced. Action. Great acting. Ingenious plot. This show is perfect. 10/10 for me
"I started watching this since there were some recommendations about it. Also quite interesting with a Spanish series. Fiorst sesaon starts out well with thge staging of a quite clever heist. Season two felt just too drawn out without adding any particular to the intrigue. Season three basically becomes a copy of first season, a new heist in a quite similar setting. It would have been much more interesting if the story had been much more around their lives as fugitives out in the world. After a while I lack complexity, and the characters are very shallow and stereotype. Overall acting is quite average, no real stars to shine. I kept watching all three seasons and was a little disappointed in the end. I had expected more. No sure if I will spend time in the next season (which I am quite sure they will make)."
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the ""bad guys"" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"Slickly sexy Spanish crime drama La Casa de papel is by far and a way an absolute show stealer. I can not think of anything i have seen that comes close to this series. Its so polished its downright blinding.

The first season cleverly blends a highly original and detailed tale of theft on a grand scale with sophisticated, deeply personal, character development, colourful narrative, lots of guns and sex.

interestingly too for all the action to be found in this series, which include a couple of pretty decent gun fights, there is not a lot of true violence. Indeed, given the setting of this series, the body count is pretty low. Not an easy thing to do but to be honest this series feels ""lighter"" and more enjoyable for it. A refreshing departure from the blood soaked crime drama's coming out of the US in particular.

I devoured the first season almost in one sitting and was left wanting much much, more. The Spanish have managed to set a new benchmark for crime drama everyone else should aspire to. 10/10 from me."
"First of all, they are bad guys. So if i get to see all the robbers in the prison I'll be happy. Second of all, the show doesn't seem to understand that they're bad guys and robbers!!! Season 4 was such bull. For an average IQ this season was subpar in terms of everything. The subplots didn't work, the professor was someone else entirely and there was somuch drama it felt like a reality tv show where all contestants are locked in one house. Also, why do none of the hostages do anything?? And why did they have to make Arturo such a bad guy? Makes no sense"
"If you are looking for logic and common sense.... this series is not for you. Its still a big mystery how they are able to rob the bank. The script is flawed but its nonetheless entertaining and gripping at times.

1. They have trained for 5 months together and yet they cannot even get along without pointing a gun at each other every 10 mins or so. While in the flashbacks, they are one happy family.... during the robbery they are the opposite.

2. Its unknown when and how the Professor falls in love with Inspector Raquel and vice versa after two meetings. While viewers are mystified ... the Professor risks the whole robbery ( his goal in life ) because he has suddenly met the love of his life.

3. Tokyo is unbearable. One does not know if Tokyo's character is supposed to be mentally retarded because she switches from sanity to insanity every 5-10 minutes. There is no explanation for her behaviour given the fact that in the past she has exhibited responsible behaviour and realises the seriousness of the situation.

4. The last episode the police is ready to break into the bank, but Miss Nairobi wants to print more notes !! Berlin says no and what happens after that is something u see throughout the robbery....robbers attacking each other personally. Everyone is moving at snails pace while Rio and Tokya get engaged in a conversation about they will do at the beach etc etc. ( i skipped that... it was painful) This is despite orders from the Professor that the police is ready to break in and they should hurry up. It all looks very forced.... because there was no reason for Berlin to stay there trying to hold the police back. Everyone couldve escaped comfortably. While the audiences can feel the urgency for them to hurry up.... the robbers themselves are in a world of their own. Even inside the vault Oslo asks Nairobi if they can share a flat...with the police a corridor away from the vault ! And then suddenly.. they switch to normal behaviour and realise they need to get the hell out of there..and Berlin decides to stay back to allow the others to escape. Unnecessary... even though they wanted Berlin to die... they could ve scripted it a lot better. Its a bank robbery of 940( ? ) million Euros and we have been listening to their dreams of what they will do with the money. They trained for 5 months. This is the moment. This is it. Audiences can feel it.... but sadly the robbers cannot.

And there are other hundreds of flaws in the script.... the characters are not well defined....but its entertaining nonetheless."
"It has some good and unexpected moments, but also lots of thin plot points. It's written in the usual millennial style: lengthen the thing again and again. And again.

But the worst aspect is watching the characters having relationships and often taking the dumbest possible decisions. I would like to say they are totally unrealistic, but it's worse, it's like watching the Big Brother on tv: a bunch of crazy, narcissistic and brainless guys, fu**ing, fighting and switching sides all the time.

Tokyo, Rio and Angel are extremely unlikeable, Nairobi and Denver almost are. Some of them are very badly acted. On the other hand, Berlin and Moscow are interesting and well acted characters. The Professor is just, well, the Professor."
"It started with a great idea but was getting worst and worst. The characters are bad written and shallow. Part 4 is like part 2, you expect everything. No new ideas, exactly the same mistakes. Too many flashbacks in order to cover the plot holes. Till part 3 at least it's watchable. Part 4 is really bad and.... it will be continued...!"
"It started out very well, then became so silly.

Really disappointing"
Great show and I have to admit that I dislike Tokyo soo much! Such a stupid thoughtless little pathetic woman!
"A gem of a TV show. Part 1 and 2 were maganificent! Well written! acting was phenomenal! Binge worthy! This is in my top 3 best TV shows; along with GOT and DARK. This covers everything you need in a TV show with action, thriller, suspense, love, and bits of funnies especially with Berlin.

Ignore the negative reviews, trust me, I'm a stickler for reviews, watch it, this won't disappoint you. Thank you Alex Pina and others for La casa de papel. Bravo!"
"This is addictive to the point that you don't understand how you've watched it all at once.

It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!

Why it has so many mixed reviews here I really don't get it. Probably because of some inaccuracies with the plot.

I for one sometimes need a show that gives me those extreme emotions. This was one of them, I enjoyed it a lot."
"I made it through season one and a handful of episodes from season two. Many things are great about this show. A lot of great writing. Ingenious plot and original take on heist. Great perfotmances by solid actors.

Now, what ruined it for me is Tokyo. That chica's immaturity is deadly. She's the one who makes rash decisions and lands her teamates in trouble or dead (Moscow). They got away with stealing billions and this stupid cow can't be bothered to lay low? And it's Rio who gets caught! She's like an albatros! And then she has the nerve to insist people help her get Rio back, even though Rio would have been safe if it weren't for her!!! Yes, she's beautiful, but if you have that kind of crazy character in your life, that can not be bothered to wise up and learn from their mistake : you need to cut them loose!"
"I tuned into this hoping for a decent and clever bank heist tale. In some parts I got this.

It feels like they first of all gave the script to some intelligent writers who conceived of these brilliant schemes to get into the bank, deal with the police and plan their escape. The kinds of antics that make the audience think 'wow, these guys are pretty smart'. The stakes are big, the planning is meticulous and the huge rewards worthy of the effort.

When that was done, they then gave the script to a bunch of horny, adolescent teenagers who must have previously written 80's Australian soap operas. It is terrible. From establishing the actual job, it descends into a series of foolish characters who literally cannot keep their hands off each other and cannot keep their head in the game. They're shagging in vaults and toilets and offices. They're shagging when they are casing the joint, when they are doing the job and even with the lead investigator.

From a job offering untold riches and the commitment of 5 weeks and the time for the heist, nobody can stay focused on what they are doing. They utter these silly speeches about how committed they are to the job and will kill anyone stopping it from happening but then in the next scene are willing to sacrifice it all for their sexual urges or the chance to be nice to hostages.

So at the beginning, you are on the side of the criminals because their plan is so audacious but as it progresses you become more disinterested in their overly dramatic histrionics and complete lack of professionalism. There was one laughable scene where they were having another internal dispute and literally no one was supervising the hostages.

Now, I'm sure people will say that you need to develop characters and yes you do but when those characters are acting so immaturely, so petulantly and so lacking in thought or consideration of the bigger picture, you just kinda get bored with them. You start looking for the most stupid and heist wrecking thing that they could do and laughing when they do it. I didn't tune in for a romantic drama but a bank heist and when the characters are behaving like silly teenagers, the tethers to your interest just withers away.

You just want someone to shake these people and say 'we're talking about millions of Euro's each here. Is it possible you could remain on target for literally just the time of the heist (2/3 days) and then play out your love chasing routines when the job is done?' But even the guy at the very top is distracted by skirt so they all descend into silly unengaging children playing robbers.

So overall, it was a fascinating concept that was ruined, and I do mean ruined, by characters acting so idiotically that they become laughable and unlikeable. They go from the no nonsense crew in Heat to a bunch of sexed up moronic clowns."
"Is Spanish police/administration this dumb as shown in the series then 'god help them'. From the logic behind the robbery that ""we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money"" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word ""inflation""?. I wasted my 10- 15 hrs watching season 1 and 2. If you are a guy/girl who watches lot of quality movies/series then please don't waste you time on this."
It's in the same league as The A-Team: 4 guys shooting 2000 rounds each with a single clip and don't hit Gandia. I stopped watching after that. Complete waste of time.
After 2 seasons it's just soap opera. They extended it for nothing.
I shut it off after three episodes. Right after the robbers and hostages started falling in love after one day!! Got comical actually. No thanks. Horrible script. I want those hours back. Grossly overrated.
"This is one of the most overrated show i have ever seen, the downhill is so hard that it hurt me psychologically.
The romance is bad and stupid with no sense plot. 
The characters in the beginning seem to be very pro and you can find later that they are a bunch of amateurs, they will make you hate the characters instead of develop them, the insteresting ones...well... you will see
the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think ""damn nice..."" the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails.
its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show."
"8.8 it´s a bad joke only made possible due to a strong campaign from Netflix´s payed critics. This show is teen targeted but it doesn´t have to be this childish, full of one dimensional characters, hollywoodian cliches and absolutely predictable. Great movies came from Spain last two decades, movies that haded new blood and somehow redifined some genres like horror for instance, REC. is a good example , Abre Los Ojos or La Comunidad, even some spanish directors as Amenabar, Almodovar or Alex de la Iglesia are top notch movie makers. This show break with all the good that was done in recent years in Europe and is just trying to pair with american productions that are way superior like Prison Break. Three episodes after, three hours of my life that I will not get back, what a let down. Thumbs down 2 out of 10"
"I just don't get how this series got good reviews -- it is beyond stupid and every character unsympathetic, the worst of all of them being El Professor, alias Mr. Smarty-Pants -- supposedly always ahead one step -- not very hard to do with the dumbies he has to contend with. Close behind him in obnoxiousness and cluelessness is Ms Inspector who succumbs to Professor's charms, such as they are and frankly I don't see them at all - from his goofy glasses to his bad body to his Clark Kent alter ego, he is Yeccch. Honestly I was routing for his demise or capture at every turn, knowing that just wasn't in the cards as presumably we are supposed to like him. And what is it with his crocodile tears every time one of his gang dies --boo hoo we see the tears coursing down his face and 3 seconds later he is smiling, happy as can be over another scam he has perpetrated over the bunch of Keystone Kops he is up against. All of them seem to get over the death of their compadres pretty quick including the son of the father-son duo, can't remember his name.3 seconds after his beloved papa dies, he is kissing his girlfriend, the bank secretary and smiling at getting out. The whole crowd, kidnappers, hostages and cops -- bad news all of them, and may I say -- never saw any of them take a shower during the whole series yet they fornicate at will, clothes on or off -- take your pick."
"This show went from an highly well written heist, to an extremely awkward soap opera. The show did horrible in Spain until it hit Netflix. After becoming extremely popular, they hurry up and write a second heist. They are dragging one heist out with three seasons. I can't believe it went from sew good to so bad. What a disappointment"
I think the series started well but eventually it became a mess of love dramas and too many plot holes including invencible robbers and dumb police.
"As most of the reviewers I didn't knew exactly what all the fuss was about this series receiving such high praises until I decided to watch it and my oh my... It really is that good! Perfect Score, perfect script, great character development, AMAZING actors, thrilling plot-twists, great photography.

Everything is there! You will laugh and cry, you will feel the show in your gut and love it! Do yourself a favor: Stop reading reviews and start watching! Just watch it in SPANISH and not dubbed, you will thank me later! Bella Ciao Berlin, Professor and all the cast and crew for this incredible show! What a ride!"
"The first two seasons were great (9,5 points). Then it devolved into a dreary woke Spanish soap opera. The last season was unwatchable (with some good moments). There are plotholes the size of titanics."
"I just binge watched all of it in Jul 2019, I know I'm late.. I have no desire at all to watch this at first place cause I don't find any people that I like.. Turns out, after watching the first ep, I'm completely in love with this one character..Guess who ? Yeah, it's not Professor, It's Berlin..Pedro Alonso are so amazing in this show as he potrays this character well enough to make me watch this show until Part 2.. However turns out, he's dead in the end of Part 2 and I'm here still waiting for Part 3 cause we just see him appears in the trailer.."
"No spoilers here, unless we're talking about spoiled garbage. What garbage, and that's being a bit unkind to actual garbage. It doesn't really deserve to be associated with junk like this movie. The acting sucked, and for a while I thought it would turn into a parody movie but to my disappointment it didn't. Maybe I'm too spoiled by good shows, but I could not believe this show is for real."
Another Spanish attempt to suck up to America. Don't waste your time.
"S1 & S2 were great and i'd give them both 8/10, but 3&4 i'd give only 3/10, especially the 4th season.

First of all, both latest seasons were full of clever ideas and plans, but they were presented in a messy way, which led to lowering the quality of the story.

The relationships issues were problematic and made nonsense, there were a lot of overdrama brought just to make a tragic or sad story out of nothing, i mean they were tacky and boring.

HUGE MISTAKES Seeing how much the professor is a geniues makes you intuitive for each plan and each problem happens. A lot of stupid simple problems and mistakes that happenned to get bigger and more diffucult were easy to fix and should've been a part of the plan from the begining since he is always predictible of every problem that might happen and what is the soultion plan for it!

The acting in general is good; i'd say the actors who played Berlin, Nairobe and the inspector Seira were very good. But the others were just good.

I didn't find the flashbacks, especially the dramatic ones, useful or intresting, they were most of the time boring.

Camera, direction and production were at their best.

I don't like how they tried to make them look heroes, i mean okay most of us felt emotional toward the thieves, but i didn't understand the protests and the buzz around them in the show.

I find the first and second seasons great, i enjoyed them so much, season three was good and averagely entertaining but season four was bad that you can skip directly to ep 7 and you wouldn't miss anything.

I just think they should've stopped after season 2."
"One of the best series I've watched. The acting, the story just all done so well."
"My son recommended me to see this thriller series on Netflix. Each series is written very carefully with lot of intelligent details. I mean from the human and criminal side. The elements used in this story are put very clever together in a way you want never stop watching it. It offers lot of suspense, spectacle, high emotions and another dimension to understand the criminals who want sometimes justice for their undesperated situation. Finally you enjoy the great performance from all the actors. Congratulations to all and thank you for this unforgettable present. 
If you want to spend other entertaining moments don't miss the other legendary series Breaking Bad or Narcos.
My rating 10/10."
"SPOILER: Season 1 is simply great. Why?

Great story. Great acting (by most) Great characters Great pace

There are some flaws here and there, true. But this is something one should watch with the mind switched off and see it as an adventure. If you look for the illogical and try to analyse the 'plan' one may as well skip this show.

Example: The tunnel being build 5 years before, toward a federal building. Complete BS of course. But really, who cares?

Just lay back and enjoy this GREAT ride...."
"#MoneyHeist Heavy season 3 unexpected ending.

Thoroughly enjoyed it

Definitely season 3 has the toughest Hiest they had & it's gonna hook you up till the end as same as Season 1&2 made you.

SPOLIER nairobi injured

They confirmed Season 4 & Can't wait for it."
"Despite the visible decline in quality that was demonstrated in Season 3, I remained optimistic hoping that Season 4 will inject the much needed adrenaline and clever twists that will bring the show to a deserved finale. Let me put it this way, if the third season began to show small but noticeable cracks in the foundation, the fourth season decided to put a bomb inside one of the cracks and bring down the entire Casa.

I think the objective of this season was to progress as little as possible because characters end up in the exact same situation as they were at the start. Every episode consists of 60% nonsensical romance or drama, 20% obligatory and pointless Berlin Flashback, 15% Police ""Planning"" and 5% of crazy action resulting in an admittedly good cliffhanger to make sure you stick around.

While the elements of the plan are clever, they are often presented in such a ridiculous fashion that reduces their impact. The overall flow is inconsistent due to constant loss of focus in an attempt to stretch every minute. I used to love this show as it effectively balanced wits, drama and action creating a trully addictive experience. Now, it has become a soap opera that is a shell of it's former self.

"If there's one thing Money Heist has perfected since its Netflix debut in 2017, it is the art of repetition. Part after part for four years and counting now, the Spanish heist series has basically duplicated the same sequence of events over and over again. If you tune into the middle of any season, you're likely to see an approximation of this: A red-faced Colonel Tamayo (Fernando Cayo) and his colleagues being outsmarted, crooked Arturo (Enrique Arce) inspiring another failed rebellion of hostages, a stand-off between bad army commandos and good robbers inside the bank, Palermo (Rodrigo de la Serna) getting power drunk, a sudden explosion followed by a reaction shot of Professor hearing it on his earpiece from his den and asking ""what was that?"" (the camera tracks into his face with the exact same velocity too), a crowd of Madrid citizens omnipresent outside the bank and cheering for the robbers, and the death of a primary character triggering the Professor's trembling outpour of grief. That's all there is. Time after time. Throw in a chaotic terrace set piece intercut with a desperate child-birth scene (the former involves humans jumping into a womb-like opening, the latter...you get the gist), and we have Money Heist 5.

Read the full review on Film Companion."
"Netflix's recommendation algorithms clearly need some work if they think this was a 98% match. The initial premise is interesting but became an interminable endless series of:

- ever widening plot holes and layers of implausibility - some of which have been mentioned in other reviews. Will I recover from a gunshot wound as quickly as some of the characters here? Where do all the pizzas and food come from? Is the Mint cafeteria still operating during the heist? Why is the lead investigator running around doing her own thing while the whole world's media watches the siege? - the repeated use of the Long Arm of Coincidence to move the plot along - levels of incompetence among the lead investigator, Spanish police and intelligence services which make the Keystone Cops look like a highly trained SWAT team - cut-out characters whom it is impossible identify with, let alone like.

I hate-watched to the end to drink a shot of vodka each time another plot hole or implausibility came up, but ran out of alcohol long before this unnecessarily long series came to an end. Such a shame that the Spanish can cliche drama as badly as the Americans."
"Forced to watch after all the hype from friends and social media and all it took was one episode to say how pathetic the show will be, I'm really glad that I stopped after one episode, point is it didn't intrigue me enough to even continue to next episode. People who are giving unnecessary hype to this show might have never watched an actual heist movie/series or settling for too less quality content.... don't waste time on this there are fantastic series like breaking bad, better call Saul, got and people who have no taste and like this show I just pity them ??"
Just utter nonsense after season 1. So much useless drama for nothing or rather for a plot with innumerable loopholes. They should have stopped after season 1.
"Oh my oh my, Money heist isn't totally what it used to be, S1 & S2 are great, even tho they have their faults they are masterpiece compare to S3 & s4. I agree with some people saying that it should end at S2.

first, Season 3 felt like a complete replica of S1 with just one difference: gold for money it's very greedy of the professor and his mediocre team to think about another heist when they have a lot of money, in fact, millions. so why would they want more? when will the professor realize that his heist Is complete failure? maybe after all his team are dead, 'cause so far four had died. so when will it be enough professor? till your entire team is dead?

s4 is a complete disaster, in fact it is a filler season. we will just wait for the continuation of s3 when s5 comes. Nothing happened s4 that made the actual heist plot move forward. Tokyo is a surgeon, Gandia is the T2 Terminator, Rio is a cry baby that needs to be consulted every five minutes or so, there's just too many unnecessary drama in s4. why not just killed of Nairobi after being shot, but no, they decided to recovered her then killed her off three or so episodes later, what for?

ohh the flashbacks are totally out of place and have outstay their welcome, Berlin is dead just let him stay like that. some are even theorising that he might still be alive because of the flashbacks. As much as I like Nairobi, I hope they will let her dead, no flashbacks of her like Berlin. when they do that, it just makes their deaths less impactful.

I really wish they had completed the 'gold heist' in S4 like they did with the 'money heist' in S2, so two seasons for each heist would have made more sense. here's hoping s5 will be better."
"This is my first review on IMDB; I felt compelled to leave it after reading all of the reviews that trash this show. It's not a prefect show, not an all-time great show, but a very compelling and watchable show. Sure, sometimes the characters make choices that don't really make sense, and I can get some of the reviews that compare this to a soap opera. But the show is very compelling, the plot is clever, the action is exciting, there is excellent use of flashbacks, and it all ties together nicely. Overall, a good show."
"Series would have been great if they chose to end it after 2 seasons. Instead we are given the ""prison break"" treatment.

I would rate the show 3/10.

But I give it 1/10 for the casts completely tone deaf comments on the Israeli occupation, especially considering the message of the show being fighting against unjust systems of oppression."
This show easily would have been a 9/10 if it ended at season 2 It was ABSOLUTELY unnecessary to continue the series and did nothing but ruining this (imo) masterpiece of a show
"How many hours of TV can you spend focused on a single robbery? Half way through the first season, it ran out of steam and got awfully soap opera like. I made it through 13 episodes of season one thinking the heist would be resolved, but was totally frustrated that I have to get through season two (at least) before the original crime is even done. Seems like somebody said 'how can we drag a crime or for the longest possible duration - then double it and add a few extra hours of cheesy unrealistic love triangles for good measure.

Maybe seasons 2 and 3 turn three series around, but I'm not going to invest the time to find out..."
Great Spanish series. Unfortunately a streaming service ordered a 3rd and 4th season. Watchable because big budget makes it possible.
"This last part was absolute garbage and can't even imagine these things are real.

Thanks to Netflix for providing the +10sec button. Most used feature for me for watching this series.

Wish I could open any lock with 2 hair pins, wish any new born / just delivered mother can jump a 4 storey building and how can you miss the professor brain.

Uff. Endless ..

Like many others, I fell for the trap to watch this and wasted time."
Start was original and exiting. But in following seasons it's like watching a musical play with bad acting and bad writing. It's More of the same . The viewer is not taking seriously because all emotions are being overdone wayyyy to much. No subtlety of what so ever. Sad ... could be great.
"The first two episodes of this series were simply amazing. It was clever and witty as the Professor and Inspector played their game of cat and mouse. Unfortunately, due to the faulty premise that they could build an entire season on a single event (the heist), the series was doomed from the start.

After the first two episodes the pace became quite slow and boring as they were forced to throw in a lot filler in order to pad out the season. Adding on soapy romantic melodrama only brought the series down further.

I have not finished season one yet (I'm on episode 12), and I'm not sure if I will."
"This is truly one of the best shows I've ever seen. That may sound like hyperbole but it's not, it's really that good. Great story, compelling characters and outstanding acting."
"Please stop with the ""this is the greatest show ever"" because it's complete trash. Too much B.S. that no criminal would ever be involved in, people who actually like this have zero understanding of how the real world operates, hardened criminals don't behave in this manner, nor do normal adults, they act like grade school children, and there's way too much I think I'm brilliant going on here, the premise is a absolute rip off of Spike Lee's Inside Man, now there's a great heist movie."
"This is a low-level soap opera that anyone with any intelligence or self-respect will stay away from. Trivial, unimaginative, over-dramatized...and just empty on every level. Bad writing, bad acting, cliche after cliche and superficial love stories behind every corner. Everything is somehow too personal and in your face, without any taste or nuance. Characters exchange mean gossipy blows below the belt that even teenage girls wouldn't think of. Imagine the first interaction between two high-level detectives solving the hostage crisis being ""I know about your problems with your ex-husband"". Yes, it's that stupid. Oh, and the damage this show will do -- male characters constantly make rude/ sexist comments, while one of the female characters (uneducated, loud, over-confident and arrogant) slaps them for it and wins the day. Laughably cheap and obnoxious, but I'm afraid effective attempt to push her as role model to young girls. God save us.."
"Spoilers

Money Heist (English translation) is a well made, well acted, expensive looking production which does a great job of balancing tension, action and character. You get into the heist almost immediately and, unlike many shows, the flashbacks to planning sessions and earlier episodes in the characters' lives rarely overstay their welcome. It's an interesting premise, the bank robbers (in this case Spanish Royal Mint robbers) are the ones who need to buy time in order to complete their heist, and they are the ones deliberately delaying any possible resolution with the police rather than the other way round.

Yes it's not hugely novel. There are clear influences from any number of heist movies, from the senior cop talking to the senior robber of Heat, to the shadowy 'how to infiltrate your enemy' of any number of spy films. And, if you've watched the Spike Lee Joint Inside Man, a part of you must wonder at what point do the creators of Money Heist start paying Russell Gewirtz royalties, not to mention Clive Owen and Denzel Washington.

So what's the problem? Well, there's one major problem: the characters' motivation. But it's an issue so glaring that I gave up on the show half way through season two, feeling like I'd be conned out several hours of my life (it certainly takes it time in certain scenes).

Why is this? Well, from the start, it's suggested that the heist crew are a highly motivated, tightly knit group who have lived, breathed and bonded with each other for months in preparation for the heist. They have total trust in their man on the outside, the Professor, and absolute faith in his plan. The Professor himself is portrayed as an outright genius who has anticipated all of the counter moves by the police, to the point where early episodes of the show make seeming disasters turn into major triumphs for the heist crew. It's very well done and appears totally organic.

Which is why the Professor shooting off in order to cosy up to the lead investigator of the police, the woman running the counter operation, is so inexplicable. What is he doing? Why is he repeatedly exposing himself to the exact person who is best placed to identify him? When a single repeated phrase or unexpected piece of knowledge could reveal him in a heartbeat? And, by all that's holy, what on EARTH is the senior officer in charge of the negotiations doing drinking alcohol in bars, meeting a new man whose surname she doesn't even know, and sleeping with him DURING the heist!? There's no planet where that kind of behaviour is understandable and it causes the escape of multiple hostages and the death of the least characterised character in the whole show (seriously, he barely has five words during his entire involvement).

And this craziness extends to all the other characters. Tokyo is setup as this badass fiery warrior who flies off the handle a lot and seems to relish cutting off her nose to spite her face. Why is she selected for the heist? She has no special skills other than making unforgivable errors and she breaks all the cardinal rules: no personal details, no intimate relationships. Her lover, Rio, oscillates wildly from puppy faced devotion to Tokyo followed by adolescent pique and regularly gives away vital information to the police and the hostage.

Helsinki, the hard, gay, Serbian soldier who should be tough as nails and friendly as cancer is portrayed as a great big teddy bear. Denver, admittedly only present because his dad needs him there, shoots from 'stick it out till the bitter end' to 'we must leave now' whenever the show needs a second crazy robber to mess things up. And Moscow, his father, disappears for episodes at a time, but turns up in order to have a panic attack and get someone shot, before disappearing again. Critics of this piece will say Moscow has a task to do and that's why he's off screen, but that's no excuse to make him disappear for episodes at a time, that's just bad writing.

Meanwhile Nairobi is initially one of the few robbers keeping it together, but starts doing the same moronic actions midway through season two because the writers think 'we need someone to do something really stupid now and we've already pushed the other characters too far.' Which leaves us with Berlin. Inexplicably this rapist psychopath is by far the most sympathetic character throughout, maintaining the same set of principles (faith in the plan balanced by a desire to survive) from the beginning to the point where I stopped watching. And he gets repeatedly blindsided by every other robber, including the Professor, comprehensibly failing to do their job.

And the less said about the opposition (going through various stages of lovesickness, horniness, sexism, aggression, and occasionally stunning insights from a completely irrational basis) the better. Plus don't get me started on why the loudest, most awkward hostage, who has ADMITTED to being part of an escape attempt, continues to be allowed to wonder around unsupervised by the robbers.

All this adds up to one thing: bad writing, which is a real shame in a show with a very strong premise that is put together genuinely well. This is one of those programs in which the writers make characters do things not because the characters would do them, but because the show needs the error in order to generate tension.

My expectation is that, by the conclusion of season two, all the questions about why the Professor has seduced the lead investigator will be answered and everything will be neatly wrapped up, with a few deaths to make things painful for the viewer. But I can't keep watching a show that doesn't respect my intelligence and I genuinely believe you shouldn't either.

Do yourself a favour. Give Money Heist a miss."
One of the Best of the Bests Internation TV show I have ever seen...I could not miss single moment from the episodes.
"So I didn't watch this show because it was in Spanish and knowing that there was still an English version, I didn't think the English version would match up. Let's just say this is by far the most impressive tv show I've ever watched. I compare it to Prison Break, it's that good and that intense! There's so many things that happen, it definitely keeps you guessing and wanting more! I just started season 3 and I can tell you I don't want to stop watching! The things that happen are insane and the Professor is immaculate!"
"One of the best series I've seen in a long time, it's exciting from the first to the last episode, I love it! 
Berlin character for me was the best, I had some great laughs with him."
"It's one big Antifa circle jerk. wtf, hilarious subversion of expectations. The professor is the resistance. How pathetic."
"I loved the flick . It's great that Netflix is coming up with such series because this series was a flop in Spain but hit globally after Netflix acquired it .Every element story , content , screenplay & some spices of twist & turn that you as viewer will completely unexpect . I completely got addicted with this & it stayed with me for some time when I completed the seasons . Having said that do avoid it if you don't like violence ."
"The holes came along midway thru the 1st season and failure by the end of the 1st. Great production, look and players. But a disappointment. I won't continue into the 2nd."
"If you're on adult, you'll start wondering about IMDb's excellent reviews of this very naive and complete nonsense series after episode 1. But then you notice the reviews are paid by Netflix, all phrasings very similar, no effort, all 10 points. The series would've had a lot of potential, interesting theme, BUT either this was made for teenagers or the creators have ignored one major fact: mastermind criminals who have been training for months aren't loose cannons after only 48 hours, having sex with everybody, dwelling on their personal problems, hostages don't develop a Stockholm syndrome in 48 hours, leading police detectives don't go for dates (with criminals!) during a massive hostage drama, and police officers don't turn into drunks and commit suicides in 48 hours. It's just so hilarious that all these people behave like the hostage drama had been going on for weeks and months. One of the funniest things is that the gang takes the eyeglasses of of of the police officers and installs a bug on the frame in front of the police officer, and he doesn't notice anything!! It doesn't help that everybody is overacting so much it hurts. I suppose this was meant as a comedy or a thriller for teenagers. I'm kind of angry that they ruined a good idea this way."
"The brilliance behind this is astonishing! When you keep in mind the fact that the most intelligent of characters and the cleverest of plots are not above those creating them, you can really appreciate genius. And this is it. Two perfect robbery plans nearly perfectly executed. The stories, however, are perfect. The characters in this are very reaslistic. His crew of mishaps is the only variable the Professor cannot perfectly control and thus is the only weakness of his plans. Well, his second plan was not as perfect as the first one, in the sense he had not foreseen all the moves of his opponents, which were cleverer than before, but he still managed to show the genius worthy of a world-class chess player.

Definitely recommend!

Will be watching it again and again for many years."
"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."
"Money heist had a good first episode filled with a potential good story, good character introduction, good acting, great visuals but left a bad taste in my mouth because of the ending of the episode when the female lead character took matters into her own hands and compromised the plan because of her lover who is also with her all while she is being introduced to the viewer as someone who just a few days back lost the love of her life in a heist. In the same episode? The romance felt forced and rushed. Then in the second episode. It turns out that her lover didn't get shot and she compromised the whole thing because of someone she just met and he didn't even get shot. Damn that's stupid. But thankfully she didn't compromised the plan very much cause she can't aim while being a professional. Next on, the forced couple fights while a hostage seizes the opportunity to take her phone not to call someone but to delete a nude. Yeah right, to delete a nude while being taken hostage. Anyways through plot magic the police hacks in these milliseconds her phone camera and has a livefeed from the room and catches the main female leads lover while he rushed to grab the hostages phone. The police finds out who he is. And the plan gets more compromised. In episode three, the mastermind behind the plan orders to find the phone from which a colleague got identified. The main female leads lover eventually confessed that he himself was to blame. And his colleagues rightfully beat him up because it's the second time he and his forced love with main female lead compromised the plan. Then the, in my opinion, maniac and not at all professional main female lead takes matters into her own hands again and shoots the cameras which serve the actual mastermind of the operation. Because she is a PROFESSIONAL. That's when I stopped watching.

And don't get me wrong. I like that their plan is kinda failing. But three episodes all because of a stupid wild and possibly dementia(she had the love of her life in episode one killed) suffering main female lead is kinda enough. Especially since I know the creators intention was to create a fearsome and cool main female lead and it backfired in the most laughable way. It got me thinking that it is perhaps created for teen girls and should not be regarded as a serious tv show. If that is the case I change my rating to 6.

It's just a pitty cause the series in other aspects really promised."
"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.

First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical ""we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother."" If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after ""the View."" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)

Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!"
"It's amazing how a great show can be ruined to the point of no return when they don't know when to stop. THIS could have been one of the greatest TV show of the modern era but Netflix decided to take a Hollywood turn after season 2 an completely ruin the show. By the end of the last season, you have a sope opera, combined with Fast & Furious nonsense and brainless ending."
After season 2 money heist loses all the glamour there was no reason for another season... however it is worth seeing the first 2 seasons but don't watch at the other 2 if you want to keep a nice memory of this My rate is for all the seasons that why you see 4 out of 10 My rate for the first 2 seasons is 7 out of 10
Just sex and Full of extra marrital affairs. Honestly i wasted my time watching the first season itself.
"Well, it's not the best Netflix series nor the worst. It has its ups and downs on regular intervals. This series has so many twists that you start expecting the twists even when there are none. I've found this as cheesy like bollywood flicks honestly. I must say, a very over rated and over hyped series ."
"Such a nice surprise ! A great story, a suspenseful plot implacably unfolding, a lot of unexpected twists. A lot has already been said on the acting, which is impeccable. But what's most remarkable is the writing, so inventive and clever.

I never thought that the story would keep being captivating for 13 episodes, but it did. And then some...

In the beginning, you think it would be wrapped up in 2 or 3 episodes, what more can they come up with?

But it never gets boring, not for a minute. 13 hours later, I'm under the spell!

Well done, y'all !"
"A great story well told . Everything about this series is faultless . Acting , direction , plot , thrills . I finished Season 1 last night and can't wait for Season 2"
"Started with a nice idea, reminding me a lot of inside man, then it went downhill. Lots of plot holes and things that don't make sense. It was a nice change to watch a Spanish series though. It can be a lot more enjoyable if you don't think of what you are seeing I guess, but I couldn't. The plot holes, the most stupid police in the universe and some very annoying meaningless characters, like seriously what on earth did Tokyo bring on the table as a thief, no expertise on anything, just there to poke her nose into everything like a hot headed arrogant she was.

Sorry but this is definitely not a 10. It could easily be, it had all the potential, many things it did right, but if you are lacking in the scenario it cannot be hidden behind some very nice character progression, performance and general atmosphere. And don't get me started about the ending, common."
"First two seasons are great but it's getting boring from season 3, it's all soap opera. They're crying and making love and being stupid, where the hell is your criminal professionalism?? It's a show about heist, all the planning and execution, clever strategies, action, thriller and you're showing love stories, increase in family members, breakups, all kind of teenagers drama. Tokyo-Rio is the most annoying characters. You're all criminals, act like one! Stop with the 4th season, you're ruining a good show."
Bunch of Noob robbers- Noob Cops- and waste of your time.
"Series one and two were a great story, great actors, great cinematography, color-grading... However it was a closed story with a clear end. They should not have continued it and create a third, fourth and even fifth series. This is a great example of creating a sequel just for the profit."
"If you like money, you'll love it. If you like crime scene, you'll love it. If you like to see heist, you'll love it. This is best best series, I've ever seen. It keeps you involve in to the episodes. I didn't get bored in any of the episode. It keeps you thinking what will happen next and show different things. May be you expect something but something different happens. May be you never thought of this to happen. I enjoyed the series a lot. If I see any episode, I feel to see next and next and next till finish. Finished in 3 days completely. Don't compare this to any other series or movie, all have different aspects. I liked all the characters, acting, direction, cinematography and execution. It's the best. Must watch series!"
"I can only assume that these positive reviews have been paid for, or are from people who have seen a very limited amount of shows! This is average, at best. To give my reasons:

The overacting is incredible; from people visibly shaking to show that they are under stress, to manic grins and laughter at totally unamusing jokes.

For a bunch of ""professionals"", the characters constantly make ridiculous, stupid decisions. I mean laugh out loud stupidity.

The plot is paper thin after an intriguing start, and still managed to slow down to walking pace in the middle.

There is misogyny and homophobia throughout.

The plot holes are to numerous to mention.

Having said that, I did watch it all, sometimes in disbelief, and mainly because my OCD won't let me stop half way. What a shame that a decent idea and set up could be wasted like this. How on earth people can make this a highly rated show I will never know. It is an insult to all the quality shows out there that could be enjoyed!"
"I've watched 2 episodes and I can barely make it to episode 3. It's THAT boring. And I live in Europe, where this show is supposedly popular (according to Wikipedia). I don't understand the hype around this show. Too bad, because the narration in the first episode was interesting, as well as the story."
"I am really surprised to see that people love this tv show so much!! I believe it has very unrealistic and repetitive scenario especially from season 3 it is repeating itself same scenes and same dialogs. As a person who watched and followed many different series and genres, I found this tv show super dramatic and boring!!! I was skipping many scenes from season 2!! I believe any one who would be an actual tv show watcher and familiar with good directory will never consider this childish show watchable!!!! It's like a joke to me that Netflix wants to make another season!! Maybe it could be put in the kids section????"
"The plot has very primitive line. First robbers have some advantage, after that police makes move and this cycle continues on and on. Moreover, all characters are invincible, they can get hurt but still continue to live. Please, don't waste your time on this."
"I wasn't expecting much after the end of season 2 but this season turned out to be great and intense to watch, the storyline was amazing"
A great idea turning slowly into a Spanish telenovela chewing gum.
This series have some suspense but some characters are extremely irritating. It's like Prison Break and more entertaining but some stupid character decisions makes me mad. It ends at season 2. Don't watch season 3.
"This is the best series I have seen awesome story good twist and turns,the professor was really smart you sort of routing for him"
"So overrated, if we are going to talk about the first 2 seasons it's average too because the idea is not so original too. but season 3 and season 4 were too ... I don't know what to say it doesn't have the magic of the first 2 seasons. first 2 seasons good seoson 3 and season 4 were not that good."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides that

Bad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:

1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??

2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,
main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded area
main inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 days
the group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the dead
how the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)
In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?


3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every time
Most of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at times


And now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"
"Two bank robberies can be seen in this series. In this series, you can see a group of robbers who strive for advancement in life. This is a great thrilling series. We watch every episode anyway to know what is going to happen next. Mainly the fourth and fifth season is more thrilling. Definitely watch it for a good thriller."
"More of the same on season 2 of this excellent Spanish film series, Just binge watched on Netflix,, it seems Netflix seem to do foreign language shows a lot better than the American or English made shows, none stand out when compared to mainland European, why this is, well I think there's just better talent outside the mainstream it tells its own story when all I can watch on Netflix is subtitled, oh ya money heist is excellent, if u seen season 1 u won't need me to tell u how good it is"
"Everything is just so mediocre in this TV-series....plot, characters, actors you name it. It only takes 20 minutes to realize you're watching total trash so you wonder....where's all these great reviews coming from?"
"Boring, fairy tale film, nothing to do with reality, ridiculous."
"Character development, story development, script writing, acting. Most series don't have even one of these. This one has it all. And without any CGI or technical tricks, they batted it out of the park every episode. No wonder it won so many awards. I will miss all of them!!!!!!"
Money Heist is the most amazing tv series I've ever seen
"Captivating yet mind blowing! speechless honestly, words can't express my thoughts but one question season 4 ???? y'all can't end season 3 like that , questions are invading my mind nonstop"
Character development & story tie ins are extremely well done. Some situations a little over the top but few stories have drawn me to so many characters. Writing & scenario explanations are well done.
"The series started with a good story and should have been ended since season 2 thats it, season 4 is the worse, a season with no meaning and no story and just a waste of time."
"Sure, there are a few plot holes, and it does drag a bit at times. Not a series I could watch a second time, but I have NEVER seen a series that is smarter, or better at developing the characters. It's also not too heavy on violence and other obscenities.

The Plot Holes - Tokyo riding that motor bike into the mint in season two was a bit much for me, and why on earth do they not kick Arturo out of the Bank in season 3? That guy is poison to their operation. BUT I figure its easily worth the ride so go with it.

The Beauty - You really can't stop watching it, I felt like I was taking some kind of opiate it was so compelling. Where do you even begin?? These characters are so deep and well developed, half the time they are trying to kill one another and the other they are saving each others lives. The line between heroes and villains is blurred to perfection.

As an American, I can see why this show might turn off some my fellow countrymen. American's often times need their shows to be resolved in a neat little package every 60 minutes. Or assuming they do have the IQ to handle a serial program, they need to see perfectly sculpted actors fresh out of a J Crew catalogue. Or worse, they can't make it 30 minutes without a sex scene or someone's brains being splattered. Forgive them, they are an unfortunate group."
"The script doesn't make sense on so many levels that it's hard to believe it's not bad on purpose. But it isn't on purpose, it really tries to be umpredictable and clever, in the end it's only pretensious."
Acting +story line is superb .. must watch show if u have liked breaking bad n given 10/10 then its pretty much same
There is a huge mistake in the plot. Why didn't the robbers negotiate a deal with Gandia to surrender himself and let Tokyo go in exchange for the life of the Governor? They had the Governor in their possession all this while and didn't make use of him. That's plain stupidity. What about the genius mind of the professor and the criminal minds of the robbers? This hole in the plot is unpardonable and it made a mockery of the whole season.
This is what happens when netflixnbuys a shoe jist to make money. So stupid.
Unnecessary extensions illogical scenes and fights. From 3rd season it became much for like a bollywood masala movie. And by 5th season I m just reading the episord description from wikipedia instead of watching it.
"In the beginning it's so refreshing but from episode to episode it's just the same. Professor knows everything, no matter what's going to happen. Main characters rarely die and if they do it's a heroic death. Always the same methods to make police officers do what they want. Relationships between the characters are rarely catching and to me it's just bad acting since season 3. The motive for the second heist is just a joke. They should have ended it after two seasons. Now it's pure greed, nothing more."
"After a spectacular Season 1 & 2, season 3 was okayish but perhaps riding on success, Netflix just completely ruined up with season 4. Disappointed."
"The only good thing about this series is the first episode, which makes you think it may be interesting, but then you may start noticing the similarities with ""Inside man"" and wondering if it's going to go the same way.

You wish it would, because this is actually much, much worse.

Probably conceived by a teenager without a single original idea, the script revolves around a bunch of stereotypes, such as Tokyo, the sexy thief (who would probably be better cast as a stripper); the mastermind Professor (an autistic that oversmart everybody); the ice-cold, hardened criminal Berlin (who is gossiping nonsense more than a Tarantino character) etc...

I gave up after the episode in which Berlin, for no reason whatsoever, takes one of the female hostages to his office and tie her to a chair (no reason for him to do that, just to drag along the story), while in flashback we see Tokyo and toy boy Rio having sex in the toilets (a scene repeated in countless movies) and the mighty Professor outsmarts everybody once again.

Teenagers will love it, because the bad guy are actually supposed to be good and there is nothing bored people like more that a fantasy where bad people do bad things and end up winning."
"It starts off great and then gets worse and worse. The Professor is THAT almighty that the whole show is boring as hell. First I really thought - no joke - that this is a fan-fiction the Professor wrote about himself as he is absolutely flawless, knows everything, is allowed everywhere, seduces the most important woman in the show without problems (even it is said that he is completely helpless in those situations) It is so... frustrating and bad, it kills every suspension.

Everything that happens always swings in favor of the criminals, mostly because of the Professor who resolves any problems within seconds and never, never, never gets any problems. He is always on the perfect spot for everything he wants to accomplish. And it aaaalways works out, it is so bad.

But the most annoying thing is that this show really wants us to believe that the bad guys are the good ones. Women falling in love with them even they're risking other hostages lives. But lets not forget: They terrorized 67 people with great fear, giving them mental scars for live, forced a woman into sexslavery(!), risking health and mind of so many people. They threatened them, they put them in danger, they tortured them! AND THEN - no joke - it takes one sentence(!) from Berlin in an Interview to bring ALL People around the world on their side? That is insulting for ALL people who ever were in such situations. Those people would even make a show about a concentration camp in Nazi-Germany into an all funny-Nazi-Mess..."
"""La casa de papel"" is an interesting case: a series that's written to be gripping and exciting yet at the same time doing it in all the wrong ways. It presents itself as the story of ""the perfect heist"" - a robbery so meticulously planned that the only way it could fall apart is if the people executing it botch their jobs really badly.

Guess what happens? Six out of the nine people involved botch their jobs badly, including the mastermind.

Fortunately, everything works out to the result of maximum suspense. Unfortunately, that happens at the cost of throwing away logic in more than one place. Not that you'd really mind if it were done ironically, or at least with a little self-awareness of the increasingly over-the-top developments. But the series insists on its own seriousness again and again, even when it has clearly gone beyond logic and went into A-Team ridiculousness.

What holds this series together is a group of talented actors, if you do not count Tokyo, who seems to know only one facial expression, very much like a female Nicholas Cage, except when she's having a breakdown. All the others sell their scenes convincingly"
"I suspect a lot of the good reviews are from Spanish speaking people. The dubbing is laughable, terrible voice acting. Even without that the story starts off pretty good then slowly gets worse, with silly plot lines that don't make sense. Disappointed"
"I watched Part 1 without having much expectations. I almost skipped Part 2 as well thinking they just want to get more from the franchise by extending the story. At the end, I just had to admit it was a brilliant series and everything that happened throughout actually makes sense. Sure it has its flaws. Sometimes it's a little too over dramatic. There were some questionable character continuity as well where some of them act differently from how they were portrayed to earlier. But the overall suspense, twists and action more than make up for it. It was just straight up smart and unique in good way. Highly recommended."
"I am not good at writing reviews. So, when I say this is a great show, believe me it is."
I watched the first season to please my daughter and have never in all my years seen a more ridiculous piece of contrived nonsense masquerading as entertainment. Maybe it's just me because a lot of people seem to be enjoying it so good luck to them!
"This show is too much alike to the movie ""inside man"" of 2006 in wich Denzel Washington and Clive Owen make a perfect interpretation.
The same turns... and the same tricks to fool the police... there are so little differences. 
They could do something diferent but the copy the same thing.
If you are thinking of watch this show... better see the movie ""Inside man"" that is way better than this one and is original. 
The performance of the actors are ok... 
Is well filmed..
But is a copy ..."
"Watched 8 episodes yet but took only 8 hours. Couldnt stop watching with all twisted episode ends. Intro video and music amazing. Directing and acting is fine. (Im not used to Spanish show, so.) Story keeps getting you everytime with every new information. Impossible to get bored. A well designed heist plan, extended through season. We're slowly learning plan steps one by one. that keeps couriosity high. i wonder how its gonna end. Hope doesnt take too long for Netflix to air part 2. we need closure and we need it now."
"Many films have been made with this genre, but this serial has everything ."
"The show starts with done to death bank heist and makes most ridiculous heist ever.

Inside Man, although full of plot holes, was decent enough movie. This makes Inside Man Oscar material.

There are bunch horrendous turn of events no sane person will believe and then the story which is beyond ridiculous and makes you question hoe come one believe this at all.

This is perfect example how a no logic full garbage show can be made."
"This is comedy, romantic and trash. Only season one is good!"
"I can't believe the number of people rating the show so low and taking it so seriously like it was based on a true story or the producers are asking viewers to hand in their kidneys or their first born children.

Its just a fun fantasy show and all you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. A great show that hasn't come from Hollywood should be celebrated.

I enjoyed every second of all 4 seasons and you will too. Can't wait for season 5 starting in a week. Fantastic show."
"I accompanied the show since it became a global phenomenon, and the first two seasons, place the bar for heist movies / TV shows on a whole other level.

The customs, the characters, the set, the cinematography every thing was brilliantly made, the concept itself has been portrayed many times throughout the years but this was one of the most creative approaches I've seen.

Of course all of this was only possible because of the engaging and amazingly portrayed ""Professor"" character, this highly intelligent individual that due to his past among other reasons, is the master mind behind the assault to the Royal Mint of Spain where the country prints its money

The planning and methodology of the assault is amazing, and throughout the first seasons you can even see some elements of tension and realism very present on shows like Breaking Bad - everything was thought out by the Professor, and the unreliable narrator type of narrative allows for many twists to happen.

The anti-establishment message and the way all of the grey areas are depicted, made it become an instant success once Netflix started to stream it but for me personally that was also why the show started to lose quality.

The first two seasons are incredible and should stand on their own, its clear that the show should have ended exactly there, it would have been perfect and an obvious 10/10, but of course greed always speaks louder.

The third season is not awful, you can still find yourself engaged however things quickly turn bad on season 4.... The realism went out the window, with pathetic gunshot fighting scenes straight from bad Hollywood action movies, poor dialogue, soap opera relationships and there is even a Rambo type character which takes out all of the show essence.

Sure, the show doesn't end bad, it has a decent finale, however the impact and connection you made with it on the first seasons fades completely once you see the 4th - it started amazing and it ended fine but somewhere along the line it lost its own identity, and it's sad in the sense that it could've been remembered for being one of the best TV shows made."
"1. Robbery at 1st place is never justifiable . Never! Imagine someone killed your mom and then that dude starts giving emotional justifications, would you melt and let him go off happily? That's exactly what Money Heist promotes. You kill national guards yet go absolutely unharmed. Ridiculous!!

2. Season 1-2 was ok they did for entertainment purpose but from the Bank of Spain plot, it takes fking 3 seasons ! And why does it take so long?....the answer is there is no genuis better than Sergio and the armymen, policemen basically are clowns. Yeah only in ur dreams buddy! If you tell me that anything is possible in a fiction then I can even showcase a normal man lifting some house with one hand and say ""Hey it's absolutely OK it's a fiction "". Fiction just can't showcase anything they want.

3. Extending on my 1st point, the final season gives justifications for the robbery . I have seen films where people are forced to kill/rob just because of emotional past or no support from law etc but then they never said that ""killing/robbery is justified"" even though he might be wronged in the past. Money Heist attempts to justify every wrong thing it does and you need to be in right mind to believe this can't be true.

4. The climax of S5 is absolutely bizzare. The kind of agreement they make at the end makes me bang my head on a wall. I was like, I am done with such crap. Also, this Berlin's son is so forcefully put into this season it was never needed. The wife cheating angle adds nothing to the msin plot, only increases its time length unnecessarily.

Overall, I know there are fans of a lot crap films/series and you can't explain these points to them they will still spit on your mouth and say ""No this show is the best "". Money Heist has a fan base like that which cannot give answers to my points I have mentioned . For people in their good mental state, I hope u understand my points and watch better shows available."
"Initially the show is very interesting and intriguing because of how well thought out the robbery is. This robbery and the detailed plan behind it is the main focus of the show and this is the fun part.

However, the longer the show goes, the more the robbery falls into second plan and characters and their relations come forward which is not good because the entire show starts to look like a mexican soap opera. It gets very childish.

The professor figured out the plan to the finest possible detail, but for some reason decided to hire 10 street idiots to carry it out.

The thing becomes super unrealistic, so now you have things like a secretary running around with an automatic rifle hunting down a black ops soldier, one street thug wiping out a military special operations squad or police just casually chilling out in front of banks as they are being robbed for basically entire show and not doing anything about it. These heists wouldn't last 2 hours in the real world.

I would recommend watching season one just to give it a go. Any more than that should be a big no."
"Toady this series last 5 episode arrives of mosense vol 2. I waste my sleep to watch this 5 episode now it's 1:27 am. And fckn bad and worst ending for me. That mfs thieves win which i didn't want. Show is entertaining but very very below average just for mass audience to entertain no logic, no realistic amy thing happens just like boldly South Indian movie. Just for people who don't use their brain only for entertainment is this about."
"It all started great, solid performance overall. Really good way to interpert the system and how a clever team led by a genius can hurt all that corruption. But after season 2, things got way too repetitive and exagerated. It became dumb. Alpha male ladies who make compulsive decisions. The same characters doing exactly the same mistakes. You can predict pretty much every move they'll do after season 2. It could have been an amazing tv show, but it ended up as on of the worst ones in my list. HUGE CLICHE."
"Most overrated show i ever see!!

stupid acting, nonsense events"
"Terrible acting. Unrealistic and underdeveloped characters. Even more unrealistic conversations between characters. The Plot, although had a great potential, was immature with illogical links and ridiculous outcomes. And out of all the characters one could criticize in this tv series lets discuss Tokyo, oh my goodness, a neurotic, mentally unstable, unrealistic character and even worse execution by the actress. Repulsive!"
The show is trying hard to be realistic although it is not at all .. overdrama about every situation .. you feel like episodes are empty nothing new . Plot holes everywhere . Unnesecerry conversations . Idea is new and acting is not bad .... nothing to be special . P.s : Its like an indian movie . Amazed of this high score .
You can't deal with the forth season. So bad... no words
"Good series, but wtf happened in season 4?!

Annoying Charakters, stupid themes, backflash to a complete useless marriage... how can you not hate the new inspectora? And why are there so many couples???

Completely busted the whole stuff!"
"I watched 3 episodes and here my description of this title: a dumb professor hires a bunch of dumb paranoid impulsive criminals putting the biggest idiots in key roles of the heist hoping that these imbeciles can follow his plan and no, it is not a comedy. The whole thing is just too dumb, I agree that it is definitely original, in the dumb way. If you watch Ocean's Eleven 11th time you get a lot more entertainment then this parody. This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars."
"BRILLIANT SERIES!!In every way ""la casa de papel"" is stunning!It describes the feelings of a common south European citizen at this time about the economy and society!Great actors!Great script!Great music!Great scenes!Great plot!10' from a Greek fan!!!"
"No smart writing. Tokyo is such an annoying character. So is the professor. Could've done it better. They could learn a thing or two from shows like 24, Prison Break etc. No thrill whatsoever. It's a very average show. Only people who can find it thrilling are people who aren't familiar to this genre and haven't watched a lot of masterpieces."
"This show wants so much to be taken as a serious crime caper, but lacks any kind of believable hard edge in its execution, so much so that that were the sex (needless) & violence (comic book) removed, it could easily be rebroadcast as children's TV.

The ""heist"" itself could be (and should have been) whittled down from 19 episodes (13 in Series 1 + 6 in Series 2) to about 3. There is more filler in this than in your local DIY store, so much so that what little drama actually remains is diluted and left to drown in an ocean of ponderous navel-gazing, tedious monologues and largely irrelevant side stories. The lesson seems to be that if you are ever invited on a job with a group of Spanish robbers, along with your M16 and explosives don't forget to pack some Belgian chocolates, a dozen red roses and a box of condoms. Just in case.

But, of course, the real elephant in the room: even non-criminals these days know that a large amount of unaccounted for cash is basically worthless. Didn't the phrase ""money laundering"" ring any bells with The Professor or, more importantly, the writers? Try buying something relatively small like a new car with cash and see how far you get without having to first prove where the money came from.

Modern professional thieves are more interested in precious stones, rare metals or untraceable bonds and steer clear of large amounts of paper money. Yet here we are in 2017 and a gang of dimwits think they are committing the crime of the century running off with nearly a billion Euros in freshly minted paper currency, 963 million of which is in the same denomination.

It's the crime of the century all right, but the last century - not this one. Years of planning and they'd all be caught and banged up within a matter of weeks."
"There are a few options why this garbage of a series is rated this high (low/no standards, kids as audience, bought reviews) - and I'm not saying that ratings are indicative of the production's quality, however ""quality"" may be defined.

In short: this series is laughably bad. Why? The whole acting, story etc. is so ridiculous I wondered a few times if Spanish audiences have a totally different movie language than other Western countries.

For example, there is this bunch of school kids visiting the place to be robbed by a group of gangsters. A girl and a boy from that class exchange a few initial whatsapp messages and within minutes they hold hands and seconds later they kiss! Another few minutes and they make out on the toilet!! wtf??? Same thing with a guy and a woman from the gangster group. They look at each other during their first briefing, seated like a bunch of school kids with the ""professor"" in the front. Later that day, the guy appears at the room of the chick, she initially sends him away to only literally crash with him into the bed. And that's just the way sexual nonsense in the first episode.

It goes on and on with cringe worthy dialogues and plots. The reason why the first of the robber's gets identified is because that guy left one of the school girls (then hostage) take a video to send it to her family. He leaves her with the phone in front of her to argue with a female robber (the one he hopped into the bed with), of course that chick uses the phone anyways - and of course she doesn't hide it because heavily armed criminals can't be dangerous. And so on and so on..."
I enjoyed every episodes Always one step ahead. Same like 3 % and Squid Game. Brilliant creative! Story. Love every characters. I dont think korean license would be as original.
I don't know if the director has watched his series ! The idea only is great but the acting and the scenes are quite silly.
"The whole story could be filmed in two-three episodes maximum. Acting quality is a disgrace, scenes are stupidly long and boring. Action scenes are exremely untrained and illogical. Huge waste of time, i regret every second spent on this show.."
"The decline of this show after season two is so dramatic, its actually made me expect even LESS of Netflix adaptations. The first two seasons were sexy, fast, original and suspenseful. Even with a few flaws, I still wanted more.

Then we were given the next 2 seasons. Logic? Gone! Three times the flashbacks? You bet your sweet butt! Character development? No sir! You get clones! They have the same names, but completely different personalities. I find it VERY difficult to express in ""G-rated"" terms just how disappointing these two seasons were.

Finally, ""The House of Paper"" is such a great name, who on earth went with ""Money Heist"" for the English market? That's like changing ""Godzilla"" to ""Tall Lizard"""
"If you enjoy telenovelas or soaps, this might be up your alley. Unnecessary drama, and stretching out the plot. Am on the fifth episode of season one but so far the story hasn't advanced that much. The robbers seem like they had a week to know each other and prepare for the robbery, coz the tensions and unprofessional conduct doesnt feel like they had months to prepare like they want us to believe. The show wants us to believe the lead negotiator is the best there is, but so far, it feels like she is not as good as advertised. She made one mistake so far and she has a nervous breakdown, and what does she do, she calls her mum and tells her everything. Doesn't seem so professional, and comes off as an amateur or like its her first time doing this. The characters are all very sloppy, making stupid mistakes just to stretch out the story. Its just lazy writing in my opinion, though it appeals to a certain audience i know."
"A show that greats no matter the language it's watched in. the characters are great, the plot is exquisite, and the show provides continuous entertainment."
"Extremely annoying characters like that kid from walking dead, all of them. The police inspector is especially annoying and incompetent. The hijackers behave like small children, constantly arguing and picking ridiculous fights. You start hoping they die. Constant monologues and unnecessary filosofical pauses. The police tent of operations is also open for all public to visit. And oh how the plot hole list goes on.... It has more holes than a swiss cheese. Should be in dictionary for overrated. To enjoy go see with zero expectations."
"Want a good advice, stop after season 2. The first two seasons were quite good, despite some questionable characters but overall a really good series.

Then season 3, well ok it was not great but the big problem really is the characters. Some are too stupid to be real. They are supposed to be among the best thieves around but really, apart from the professor, a blind pig would execute better. It's so ridiculous that you simply cannot take the series any serious. This series has become a joke, the characters mere clowns straight out of Jersey Shore. It's really become the professor and his circus. Kind of sad!"
"This series started well in the first 2 chapters, then declined significantly, especially the 4th season So the 4th season starts with Nairobi bleeding to death and then she has a perforated lung and then all of a sudden they are able to perform a surgery on her and take the bullet out and boom she survives it. This series is too vulgar and not mentioning all the useless scenes. Every 5 minutes someone is yelling at someone and they have their gun pointed to their head. LOL Not to mention the rest of the useless details and how the producers treat the audience as stupid. Bottom line: Don't watch it"
"It's rubbish. Period. The problem is that the show takes itself very seriously but ends up becoming a caricature of itself. I have no reservations towards mindless entertainment but the sheer audacity of the writers to pull anything off from their hat under the pretext of a mastermind professor for me, is ridiculous."
"Halfwas season two, I think the series is predictable and the story is too long. It feels like they could have done two seasons in one easily."
"Wow this show is mind blowing I'm in love with each and everyone of them, every character had their own right with the scenes , the acting is top notch I applaud everyone for that brilliant performance, I'm in love with the professor period. Thank you so much for the amazing and hopefull ending, I know they are thiefs but they had my sympathy to wish they succeed in their operation."
"The series is definitely a great entertainment all along with a lot of action which keeps you hooked all through the 5 seasons.

It is definitely enjoyable and i did not get bored even at a single episode.

I don't get why people are hating on the last 3 seasons but I recommend you to watch it and decide that for yourself. The professor is the most interesting character whose intelligence provides the gang with all the brain they need.

To be honest I am sad it ended and want to watch more of it.

There are some downpoints to the series but i dont think thats an issue since that sort of thing happens with every other series you watch."
"... you should engage your critical and objective viewpoints regarding this over-blown series. It's easy to fall into the trap of it being a 'robin hood' type movie and maybe that was the intention of the writers. But it fails because the plot lines are ludicrous, it's full of holes, the acting is one-dimensional and, worst of all, one can't feel empathy, or even care, what happens to the characters."
"To put it simply, it is superb. It has everything - action, suspense, drama, tension, love, tears, humour, utter daftness, a serious message, a ludicrous message. And that most important of things for a programme like this - a group of characters that, despite their many flaws, you fall for, like and want to win. Okay, and develop a wee crush for in a couple of cases!

The acting, writing, production, make up, etc etc is first class. You really can tell that every single person that was involved in the making of this was dedicated to the final product.

WELL DONE AND THANK YOU."
"This show is over hyped.. may be for the users who just purchase Netflix subscription and see this show in trending shows. There are lots of plot holes and weak story.. compare to breaking bad, narcos , fauda this show is just for the kids not for adults"
It's so hard to imagine anyone actually writing this show. It was hard to watch at all.
"S1 and 2 were on one bank heist which had a solid plot and the action was good. Season 3+ on the other hand was bad, we had these useless 5 minutes combat scenes where not a single person could land a shot, they were just shooting in walls and whatever. How the hell did Gandia even escape after executing Nairobi. Then you have the inaccuracies where they said clip every time instead of a magazine. The grenade scenes were ridiculous, the explosion was way too big and the RPG scene was also bad they shot right next to them and they all kept shooting the second after like nothing had happened. Also, a lot of them didn't even know how to hold a gun properly. Also, you have the cringy parts like the "" special forces "" that put on face paint to enter a building, is it supposed to make you blend in or something? They can't even aim and they just scream for no reason at all while shooting. Sure an average grunt might scream like a maniac but highly trained special forces aren't screaming around like morons for no reason. Honestly, I enjoyed the show at first but I'm glad they finally ended the show because the last 3 seasons were terrible. What was that pregnancy scene, was it really necessary like wtf."
"This is the best Spanish show ! Great acting , has action , has suspense , has emotions and has many twists until season 4 came out

Season 1 : 10/10 Season 2 : 9/10 Season 3 : 8/10 Season 4 : 6/10"
"This is simply one of the best shows I have ever watched in this genre. 
Must see!"
"Totally refreshing, full of twists, unexpected situations. You are cheering for characters for the whole time. Excellent plots mixed with characters stories and emotions they are going trough. Something best I seen in years. Nothing like US Tv series where everything is expected and without emotion. Camera, special effects, acting on different level. Watch all bonuses about it."
Just completed the season 3 and can't wait for the 4. Just diabolically beast type of thriller TV series
"This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars. It´s sooo bad. 20 hours I'll never get back. Ridiculous plot. The writing is terrible. How on earth did it get such a score? What a joke... Don't waste your time on this drivel. Now I understand why in Spain this show was a failure."
"I'm not really big on series, but once I started watching Money Heist I couldn't stop watching. The plot is captivating, intense, emotional, it involves all your senses and it's highly unpredictable. It's a thoroughly thought out series. The characters are so amazing, they played their parts so well that at each point you feel so immersed like you're there with them. The professor is a genius. Berlin is a very fantastic guy, focused and principled, one of my best characters only second to the professor. Nairobi, oh my Nairobi. I can equally liken her to Berlin because she's focused on the job.

If you've not watched Money Heist, I don't know what to say to you honestly.

One of the best series I've seen."
It was great show but the greed took over and they over did it.. they screwed up good show.
"The writing is as poor as it gets and it requires you to completely suspend your reason and logic in order to follow the plot. I personally found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters, they are badly done and none of them is even remotely smart or complex. This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen in my entire life. I know there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief, but his show requires you to but your brain in the trash bin while you watch this. Plan not using it all. The characters are so stupid and pathetic and one dimensional. DON´T WASTE YOUR TIME. Spanish audience seems to be smart because, in Spain, this show was a failure."
"I loved it , it is fun and you just want to know what is going to happen in the next episode I read some of the reviews, maybe it has a few flaws not perfect, but it is fun to watch. I truly enjoyed it Also I do not understand why some persons think that the good reviews are paid by netflix, every one of my friends who saw this show liked it , so it must be kinda the majority of the opinions"
"Super good series, with a lot of excitement an never boring. Men and women will love this! Again a super good Spanish series after seen the extreme good series Gran Hotel, Velvet and Vis a Vis."
"#OneWordReview #MoneyHeist Fantastic. After hearing a news about Hindi Dubbing of Money Heist on #Netflix. I started watching. Trust me it was fantastic Hindi Dubbing. I binged watched Season 1 & 2. Both the seasons are Related to each other & this series ended with a Fantastic Climax in Season 2. For me it is definitely one of the best series of Netflix till I watched Season 2. The performance of complete Cast. Whether it was Nairobi, Denver, Moscow, Tokyo, Rio, Helsinki Berlin. For the Character Berlin is treat to watch. Such a powerful acting by Pedro. The main character Professor is the lifeline of the show. No one can better act than @alvaromorte .Raquel was also the best character of the show. There are so many powerful performances from the rest of the cast too. Tha concept is so fresh. I love the way they direct both the seasons. We are completely connected with each character. The BGM is also fantastic. The fighting sequences specially the gun shots in season 2 finale were awesome. This series is bit so long. But you can avoid this."
"I am here after the final season...and what a great way to finish this series..as a gane of thrones fan it hurts me how they ruined last season of game of thrones...but money heist you nailed it....the best ending ever..(for your kind info i also watched breaking bad"")...forever in our heart you guys?????"
"""Overhyped"" is the only word that come to my mind for this. I ywaned watching this trying to understand why this is so popular. It has started treating the audience for granted. The writing is just like a forgetable bollywood movie."
"You might have seen the name on your Netflix or heard people talking about it but weren't sure if it is for you. Stop hesitating and start watching!! It is a bomb from the first 10 minutes...the plot evolves every episode and keeps you hungry for more. Basically, Season 1 of Prison Break intesnity but in Spanish but these guys are robbing a money printing reserve. Oh yeah, to have a complete experience por favor watch it in SPANISH and not dubbed.

Absolutely stunning, now I will be monitoring Spanish Tv Shows for smth else"
"My wife and I - we loved this show, couldn't wait for the next season.

But season 5 ... omg, what a horrible, unwatchable, stupid mess. We stopped watching after 1.5 episodes.

Shame Netflix!"
"Let me start by saying, I think like many others, I was duped into watching this by its high IMDB rating. And because of this series I am 100% convinced that Netflix is paying people to give this show a high rating. I understand that people's tastes vary, however, if you enjoy stories with countless plot holes, unlikable/irritating characters, bad acting, pointless monologues, and complete nonsense, then this is a must watch. In fact, the only reason I watched the whole series, was because of how ridiculous it was. It frequently sent me into fits of laughter.

This did have the potential to be fairly interesting, yet it seems the writers went out of their way to produce complete nonsensical drivel. The story focuses on a group of supposedly highly experienced/intelligent robbers, who plan to take over The Royal Mint of Spain, in order to print and steal vast sums of money, over a two weeks period.

Yet, this group of professionals couldn't be more incompetent. They spend five months prior to the robbery, in a boarding school style setting, run by an equally incompetent professor. Not only are they treated like children, but they also do a good job of acting like children. During the robbery, each of them take turns in making completely pointless mistakes, putting the entire heist in jeopardy. There are many boring monologues between the characters, which offer little substance. A good series would normally have at least one likeable character, either good or bad, where the audience can follow them on a journey and become engrossed in the story. Unfortunately there are no such characters existing in this series. The writers attempt to use the 'sex sells' approach throughout, hoping that the audience will be enticed by random cleavage shots, and hilarious sex scenes.

The lead investigator/hostage negotiator was what really took the biscuit for me. Throughout the series she constantly makes wrong decisions, taking her lunch breaks in a nearby tapas bar, where at one point, she even drinks wine in the middle of her working day. This women is irrational, unstable, and appears to only care about getting laid. Not only has she had a 15 year affair with her closest colleague (who is married), but she also manages to bed the professor, after suspecting him of being in charge of the heist. The plot holes are really endless, and I could go on...

If you enjoy watching high quality productions, then stay well clear of this. On the other hand, if you fancy watching laugh out loud rubbish then get stuck in!"
"Without giving much away, this is probably the best robbery thriller out there. Why it's better than most? For one, how detailed it is... typically USA show is alot of fluff/waste of time. This has psychological elements (what people will do/how will they react) to predict behavior, and create a plan based on that. It's blunt and true, Stockholm syndrome is real.

Acting may have been a bit over the top but I can hardly judge since I didn't hear it in original tongue.

Overall, enjoyable 20 hours, capped off by a great main theme song.

10/10

P.S I love netflix for buying quality shows in the world. Why waste money to overpay usa show runners, 99% of whom are not creative, when you can literary pick whatever you want from the world."
"First of all - here's a newsflash to all the people here who suddenly have become cops and criminal experts and giving bad reviews because of the ""unrealistic events"" in this show: You seem to be missing that this is not a documentary or something based on a true story - this is a fictional series which should be allowed to have some elements that is a little to advanced to be true. You would'nt categorize Star Wars or Lord of the rings as ""unrealistic"" because of spaceships and wizards now would you? With that said - after a slow start this one really picks it up at the end of the first season and turns in to one of the most entertaining shows ever to come ot ouf Europe. Smart, fast paced, nice twists and turns, good acting and well executed all together. Can't wait for season 5. And people please - watch it with the original spanish soundtrack. The dubbed experience just ruins everything."
"I usually pick-up any TV series with thorough analysis after reading 20-30 reviews. But this one I picked randomly just because I liked the sound ""Bella ciao Bella ciao"" (you'll know what it is once you finish the show).

I bing watched it for almost a day because this damn thing is so fast paced & keeps you awake as if you're on a rollercoaster ride. The plot twists/ the anticipation/ direction/ oh boy 9/10.

Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters. Who thought a TV series on a money heist will be so interesting. Kudos to the creators.

Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao"
"Communism.worst , terrible ,disaster ,stupid, trash ,rubbish ,disgusting ,horrible ,torture ,garbage ,pathetic series."
"Very well written screenplay. The narration of the story is very good and thrilling. A simple concept developed into fine story, and very nicely performed characters. No need to compare it with some good series which indeed had felt boring and flawed at some parts. Comparison makes the entertainment awful."
"Seasons 1&2 were great, season 3 struggled but a fantastic finale, season four is getting a little far fetched, looks like it's running out of steam"
"I'll probably never see anything so good again, i didn't see the English version, but man was this extremely brilliant and I 200% recommend!!!"
"This is my first review on imdb, I just had to write my thoughts. It's a brilliant show, an absolute gem, might be my favorite tv series ever (matter of taste, obviously).

Intelligent cat & mouse game with tons of twists and excellent characters. You have no idea what will happen, it's full of suspense and chances are you won't be able to stop watching.

I watched 10 episodes on Netflix in one night, which didn't happen to me since the first season of Prison Break (with which this show is very similar).

PS (for those who didn't watch it all): There are 15 episodes of 70 minutes each. Netflix took the first 9 and transformed them into 13 shorter episodes for Part One. So there are actually six more 70 minute episodes left for Part Two.

Hopefully it catches a wide audience and we will get to see more of this."
"I will not say much about the plot or the actors, because both were beyond excellent. The chemistry between the actors was unbelievable, and the relationships between the characters were heart-breaking. I was hooked throughout all the episodes due to the incredible plot and its fast pace.

As for the finale, it left no loose ends in the plot, but left me in tears. So emotional, so powerful. Sometimes we don't watch shows to have the most accurate depiction of reality, rather than get away from this very reality. La Casa de papel manages to give hope in so many ways.

This show is different than anything else. Just watch it already."
"In a nutshell, it's an overrated series with neither good drama nor good heist. I couldn't sit through even season 1 completely. The lowered expectations of audience for a good series are clearly visible from the ridiculously high ratings for what the series offers, I went as far as episode 9 before my head started exploding with sheer boredom of drama, lack of lovable characters despite the overwhelming focus on their backstory and sheer amount of WTF moments during heist. These are robbers who are described as Pro/expert criminals who want to pull off a virtually impossible looking heist, all the while indulging in unbelievable levels of stupidity like Robbers falling in love with hostages, hostages falling in love with robbers, robbers performing surgeries, robbers committing amateur level mistakes and fooling collective intelligence of entire nation's security forces while doing this is something I cannot really find believable. There were few moments of brilliance with detailed planning but everything else going on there during heist was a juxtaposition to that brilliance. I read the detailed plot from 10th episode onwards to the end of second season and was glad i save myself some time and frustration. People who expect some logical explanation, some believable level of professionalism in a heist like this and in general expect some basic level of realism to the plot are going to be disappointed if they watch this series."
This series is masterpiece tv series on criminal genre after Breaking Bad! So freaking love!
"Watching this show (Money Heist) may encourage peoples/humans to do bad things more, like stealing money, etc. I hate to admit the show is good like 4/10 but bad for us."
"The most great TV shows series in the history, you will never boring"
Like watching a Chess game playing by 2 Grand Masters. Every move is calculated in advance. Every episode is nerve breaking. Climax episodes are terrifically screenplayed.
"What is this??? This series has absolutely 0 credibility. The script must have been written by a bunch of 10 years old teens (they will forgive me), full of non-sense and totally incoherent. Characters are as convincing as dummies, with no past, no depth, no real personality. It looks like they were just taken out of a manga or borrowed from a cartoon, for the sake of their supposed coolness. This is a cardboard series. If you like being a fool and be treated as one, just watch and enjoy."
"Its good binge watch but I cant help but question absurd logic used to justify character decision making.

Even if we assume eccentric characters make absurd decisions, the largest problem with the show is the Season 5 ending where the whole world sees all of Spain's gold stolen and fake gold returned yet no investor questions if the gold is real. Hell, the government having arrested all criminals, release on assumption that they will keep their word & not tell everyone that gold is fake. They should chosen a bit more realistic ending."
"I don't understand why people rate this as one I know some scenes doesn't argue with common sense come on its a series ..its role is to entertain people.. well I am entertained thank you for this.. the writers, director actors I think did pretty well.. series and movies are entertainment ..I was entertained and thank u"
"It started really good and should have ended much earlier.. now it's massively overrated, all episodes are almost identical, unlimited bullets, no one gets shot, useless flashbacks, end the episode with a cliffhanger, rinse and repeat."
"I chose to watch this series out of chance one recent day, not really knowing what to expect. In its first few seconds I realized that this is a special project. I could feel the energy, thrill, intelligence, and camaraderie soaked into the story and production. There is attention to detail, during the telling of this story of group of life-worn thieves assembled by the incredible, ""Professor"". Without revealing too much, I will say this character of ""The Professor"" is outstanding, fantastic, and so fun to watch. His quiet demeanor combined with the brilliance of his mind engaged in the intense challenges created by the heists at hand. I would recommend this series to all."
"When you can't surprise your audience in any way you have to create big dramas every season.

This show was so good, I rated It 10 After the First 2 seasons, then the plot became ridicolous

7 Just because of the First seasons."
"I want to preface this review by saying I came into the Money Heist hype pretty late into the game, so I was able to binge through all the seasons up until the S5 mid seasons finale.

TLDR at the bottom.

The first 2 seasons of this show were fantastic TV, the whole narrative and the writing really stood out. The action sequences left you on the edge of your seat and every now and then you'd say to yourself ""Oh that's genius"". After S2 had wrapped up, the showrunners ended it with a nice bow and there was no necessity to create more. The 2 seasons were brilliant in itself. The seasons wrapped up so nicely I was able to stop watching after S2 for a while until S5 part 1 dropped so I could binge from S3 to the end (Unaware S5 would be split into 2 parts).

Enter S3-5 from Netflix.

These latter seasons really just highlighted how much better the first 2 seasons were in terms of how tight the writing was.

Let's start with the good. As silly as some of the set pieces are in the show and as silly as the writing has become, it does maintain its' intensity and I truly believe that is only down to two things, acting and the soundtrack. The soundtrack is brilliant creating tension and even creating nostalgia, especially during scenes such as Nairobi's funeral and Tokyo's death. This was amplified by the second half of S5 where I found myself getting goosebumps during certain scenes just from the soundtrack. Seeing the golden pellets shower out of the pipes whilst a triumphant soundtrack plays in the background even though we knew it was going to happen sends chills down the body. The other notable thing was, to me, the best scene of the show was them singing Bella Ciao in the vault room after extracting all the gold; but I'm a sucker for feel good scenes made up of singing and instruments made from the appliances they have on hand in the room as well as any scene where a sombre song is sang whilst intercut with scenes of battle or preparing for battle. I.e. The highlight of S8 in GoT with Podrick singing. Also loved the Berlin and The Professor flashback talking about their dad and why he does the heists.

The final 3 episodes of the show really picked up. It put The Professor against the ropes as the gold was stolen from him, something he did not account for and seeing him improvise plans to get out of situations. That being said, whilst The Professor may have been put in situations in prior seasons, it was only in this season it was a high-stake thing as in prior seasons The Professor accounts for everything. If something happened, good ol' Professor had already accounted for the possibility and made contingency plans (bar the last few eps in S5). It almost makes you wonder if The Professor had superpowers if he was The Oracle or if he belonged in the MCU.

This low stakes is backed up by the ridiculous plot armour. Gandia, the security guard, was surrounded by everyone with guns and not one bullet hit him. Was the action sequence tense? Yes, for the first minute or so until you realised, they all had clone trooper aim and it became just a boring shoot 'em up. The plot armour was ridiculously irritating. Due to this there were some funny moments for me: in S4 there was a line about shooting the hostages in the vest and I thought they couldn't even shoot one guy out in the open, you think their aim is solid? Sagasta gets a knife shot out of his hand and they say they have good aim. I believe the characters in this show just shoot and hope for the best. You know the one time someone got shot was when Arturo couldn't handle the recoil of the gun and accidently shot a hostage, but don't worry folks, Arturo becomes a weapon expert later using all sorts of guns.

Now we come onto the flashbacks. Were they necessary? Perhaps, but definitely didn't need to be that long. It was cool to see Berlin back in the show but maybe a little too much. I groaned everytime a flashback appeared and only appreciated the flashbacks that actually paralleled the heist from planning to execution. However, the flashback of Berlin singing Ti Amo was very well done. Just seemed like a long way to let us know he had a wife and son that betrayed him.

As well as this, they really telegraphed plot points happening with Tokyo before her death. They chose that one ep to flashback to her past and show us all of that, made it so predictable what the end of the episode held in store. Which speaking of Tokyo, how was she narrating the show in the final 5 eps?? She is dead. Kept me wondering if she was alive somewhere spectating to be able to narrate but she was never to be seen after, unless in flashbacks so not I don't understand the reason she was still narrating.

Overall S1 and S2 had minor flaws to it that were only made apparent by the 3 seasons after but it made for great TV. It told its story succinctly and efficiently and kept us on the edge of out seats. S3-5 turned into a cliché of tropes making t predictable however it does remain intense making it a fun watch; just don't think about it too much. Whilst the latter seasons did bring it down, the final 3 episodes did raise the bar slightly by putting The Professor in a situation to adapt with great soundtracks and great acting and a nice finale to wrap up the whole show. It was good TV but not at the standard Money Heist once was.

P. S. In the finale, I got Michael Bay vibes and I was all for it. It put warm colours all over the scene. The military were there, and they had silhouette close up shots with an epic track. Half expected The Professor's speech to be something along the lines of Optimus Prime's dialogue.

P. P. S., They put Endgame style credits on the finale which was cool but disappointed they didn't put Bella Ciao in the background.

TLDR: it's a great show that became good but entertaining nonetheless."
"Season 1: awesome Season 2: cool Season 3: omg the tension is killing me Season 4: ...bad,slow,rediculous."
Before watching it I heard many times people talking about it and I gave it a try. Damnn it's one of the best web series I ever watched. However breaking bad is always No.1 in my list.
"The show really shines in the first few episodes, but after that quickly drowns in cheesy characters, senseless arguing and overall a very spanish soap opera feel."
"I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development. You can not foresee anything. (I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker)"
"Please someone tell Tokyo to look at people and camera like a normal, usual human being not like an ox. Does she really consider her look sexy ? (I am gonna be sick) Inspector has only one expression for all situtations which makes me bang my head up against the walls

and yes the show is... (Now, I am vomiting)"
This is the perfect example of how you can RUIN a nice show with some stupid ideas and none plot . Season 3 was not good at all but season for 4 omg it failed any expectations . Really nice job...
"One of the most exhilarating, breath taking and jaw dropping series available. The action moments in the series is one of the most thriller based emotionally heavy scenes that you can expect in television today. I'll rather have the enormous popularity and ground breaking critical acclaim speak for itself. Its a modern revelation which gave a new life to a genre that had been under seize for quite a while, i.e. heist genre, this series gave a new life to this genre, which resonate universal themes across the world."
"Mixing political views with TV drama to brainwash the uneducated viewers, talking about the occupation of Palestine."
"BRILLIANCE, Not only the show has a solid story line but also perfection in execution. It's not one of the show you see and forget about! It shows how imperfect can a perfect plan be. The show connects with emotions and mend them in its favor... Again: BRILLIANCE.

This is my first 10 out of 10 show, not even Game of Thrones or Vikings or Breaking Bad passed this threshold for me!"
"I hate watched this over the last two days. I wanted to watch a fast paced action story that wasn't too deep or dramatic, that I didn't need to think too much about. And it starts off with some promise, but by episode 3, I had to skip parts because they were so bad! As it went on I skipped more and more, mainly the terrible back stories and cliche character development scenes.

This should be used as an example of how not to write. Every awful cliche and trope you could think of is contained in this series. It's so over the top, so cheesy, and so very LAME. The worst dialogue ever put down on the page and with so many plot holes. Bad directing, some ok acting, a lot of terrible acting, ok camera work, good soundtrack, but with the worst writing ever.

The lead female character is constantly making the most stupid mistakes that threaten the whole plan and she spreads her stupidity to all the other characters. How am I supposed to relate to her and want her to succeed when all she does is make the stupidest screw ups that threaten to derail the whole story?

There's also the sexism and chauvinistic garbage littered throughout. ""You made that mistake because you're on your period."" -Actual dialogue! Why are there so many scenes with women in their underwear, sometimes with absolutely no reason why they would be. It's like it was written by a 14 year old boy with no experience with women and all his education from porn.

It's possible that the fact I watched it with over dubbed English is responsible for some of its problems. Maybe the Spanish actual dialogue is not so terrible and cheesy.

It's also possible that the reason this frustrated me so much is because I believed it could have been a very good show. It had promise. I would love to do a rewrite and make it what I think it could have been. I did actually like the ending - but my god was it painful to get to! The first time I groaned and cursed that I found out there was a part 2 and another horrible 9 episodes to get through until I could finish it.

People who rate this 10/10 need their heads examined. It's awful. LAME!"
"In first two seasons they built an amazing thought about the series and got a large audience, people loved the cartil, but when they decided to do 3 or maybe 4 extra seasons they are destroying all that and wasting all the efforts that has been done in first seasons They are losing the respect that they got at the beginning"
Fot me season 1 & 2 was very good but when they get famously and announced seasons 3 its ok until that and now s04 is fully disappointed. #Please stop milking that COW
Such a great series which keeps you on the edge of your seat!.
"I pretty much never watch shows in another language, but this one peaked my interest and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's really good. I'm hooked.

I love how the story unfolds piece by piece and keeps you interested. And the casting and characters are just fantastic. What really strikes me personally as refreshing, is how believable the characters are. And all interesting in their own way. There's none of that typically forced American politically correctness pushing some obvious agenda that just ends up annoying you and ruining the immersion.

Give it a shot! It's well worth it. I for one can't wait for Season 2."
"Found this octane show on Netflix by chance and fell in love. Absolutely amazing cat and mouse game with an abundance of thrill, intrigue, twists, creativity and fun. A heist show like no other! Eagerly waiting for season 3. This Spanish show is dubbed in English which makes English subtitles redundant. Highly recommended!"
Money Heist is a stupidly organized heist in which amateur thiefs deal with dumb police with so much of melodrama blended with nonsense events! It's nothing but a bigger version of daily soap TV serials! I don't get it why it is that much high rated but this is a pure waste of your intellectual & time!
"On the basis of first 2 seasons it held 10/10 from my side but season 4 is absolutely disappointing. Too much of the stupidity, plot holes, most of the things doesn't make sense at all."
"Why did they create a masterpiece just to ruin it by stalling in season 4, money is the answer. It's obvious that they filled up 4 episodes chasing Gandia with one goal, to extend to a fifth season.. No more views money heist we resist..."
"Money Heist is a good watchable series. But I don't see why or how this is getting the recognition as one of the best series ever. It's not. To be honest, the series is lagging most of the episodes and picks up pace in the final episodes only. And I didn't like the Season 4 ending much too. It felt just like any other episode. The performances are not great apart from Berlin, Palermo and few others. I hate most of the characters. I'm being so pessimistic because it's getting over optimism from many others. Overall, it's a compelling watchable series."
"Do not miss Money Heist Season 4 and binge-watch it before people start sharing spoilers out on social media. Trust me; you do not want to miss out on the madness of this heist drama. This season ended in such a cliffhanger that you'll feel restless thinking about the waiting time for its next season! So, get ready for a smashing season 5 because this is not just a heist anymore, it's a war and won't end anytime soon! Magnifique!"
"(I only could watch the first season, everything written is only applies for that)

Money Heist could be a good piece, if they make it a movie series, or a short series.

The base story is good, but it doesn't have enough content to fill up a whole series so they decided to go the path where they write stupid twists and conflicts to make up the screen time.

Some characters are out of place, annoying kids who doesn't contribute anything to the heists succes, no way any masterplan would involve them. Any storng-enough individual could learn using powertools in five months, why would bring an older man just for that?

The small thing that bothers me most is the CSi syndrome, where they want to show their technology as fantastic, way too advanced. They do impossible things most of the time. This applies to logic too, the police every time assumes everything right from the smallest information drop. ""Blurry image? Enhance. There is a face. We know everything about them now."" and so on.

TLDR: Bad writing, bad directing, bad characters and (maybe) bad acting.

Why it got the 3 stars: The picture is very good. The camerawork, the lighting, the props, the clothing, the locations/sets (except the abandoned road felt out of place/""cheap"" at the heist's beginning) and the sound is flawless.

Way to watch: The english dub ridiculous, set the language to original and the subtitles to english (cc).

Based on the other reviews, which say that the first two seasons was the better, I DO NOT RECOMMEND watching Money Heist to anyone like me, who demands logic in a story. Do yourself a favour and save those hours for something worthy."
First two seasons deserve 9 stars and the next three seasons deserve 5 or 6 stars at best but giving 1 star because Netflix milking a hit series as long as it can almost 30 episodes for the second heist and still continues they added sooo much filler content its getting boring.
"First season(s) is/are to be considered among the masterpieces of modern TV times. A perfect blend of plot twists derived from classic heist movies/books, along with original, brilliant additions that maintain both its freshness and suspense till the shattering finale. Acting is top notch, script is also flawless, character development pretty much on spot, plus no single flaw can be traced to the very last second.

However, when it comes to its Netflix continuation, I do get why many like it, but it seems a bit too stretched in a number of ways. Moments of brilliance are indeed still there, but I can't help but feel they already used most of their best cards for the original seasons. The excessive use of flashbacks, its non-stop-Expendables-shooting-spree, along with the overly dramatic acting makes it very, very blunt for my taste. The Colonel is probably the most irritating character out of all, a person with only two kinds of moods, capable of filling a spot for Space Jam 3 as the superleader of the UltraDorks. A very good actor nevertheless, he only did what he was told, but the more the series progresses the more it turns into a dark-comedy-over-the-top-fiasco.

All in all, I get how the series is split in five (or six?) parts, but to me, it's more like Season 1 and Season 2, as it's all about two distinctive storylines. Season One gets 10/10, Season Two maybe 3/10, unless the end proves elusively otherwise. If I had to place a bet though, I would say I expect that nearly everybody dies, in a way a bit too brutal, but their sacrifice won't be in vain as, along with the incoming scandals, an uprising will be inspired for establishing a healthier democracy. Is it going to end up so predictably? I sincerely hope not."
"This was a really great show in season 1 and 2. Then came season 3 which was just bad and repetitive. At the release of season 4 this started to gain a lot more attention from lots of people, example of these are the people you see in top comments which were disappointed by the hype of it due to the latter seasons. Season 4 wasnt that great but it was for sure better than season 3. The producers were meant to end at season 2 but netflix selfishness caused them to extend and butcher the memory of this great show. It was at a 8.8 on imdb before season 3,4 and the bandwagons watched it ,which should tell you a lot. Season 1- 10 Season 2- 10 Season 3- 7.5 Season 4- 8.5"
"I'm on the fourth season now and the story is stretching thin. The first heist was great, it made sense, it was a complete story. They're already rich, why in the world would they endanger themselves and go back and do a second heist? It makes no sense. I know they did it to ""rescue Rio"" but come on, man. Let's say you're richer than God partying it up in some remote part of the world and your former team leader needs you to go back and rescue a member of the team. It's not very realistic that they would all agree to this.

I liked the characters at first, but at this point in my viewing, they are starting to suffer from Character Stupidity Syndrome, a phenomenon where the show's writers continually paint the characters into corners and the only way out is to have them react in idiotic and unrealistic ways, for example Arthur breaking his way in to the second heist, PAST A POLICE BLOCKADE. Come on. But even this isn't half as questionable as the diversity shoehorned into ""5 Minutes Earlier"" as the male characters react in astonishment to seeing a distant cousin's gender transformation...it comes off as a cheap gimmick instead of a slowly building story arc that's woven into the rest of the storyline.

Despite the show's flaws, the acting is generally good, although I don't know how many more times I can watch the professor adjust his eyeglasses or Raquel react with a long, blank stare. The actress who plays Nairobi is really intense, I hope to see her in more shows or films in the future."
"The title says exactly that. Just get the robbery done and go. I don't care to see a bunch of nude and sex scenes. I fast forward through so much stuff. I couldn't wait until the end. Thank God. They all got away, the end."
"The first 2 seasons were fantastic, I can give 8 out of 10 you can even watch the 3rd , I can give 7 out of 10 But the 4th season is not gripping , not a good plot and dragged a lot . So I'm giving 4 out if 10. They should end this series in season 5."
I love how Netflix is picking up international films and translating the dialogue
"This series starts strong seasons 1 and 2 but they then took advantage of them to make other seasons but I am sorry they ruined it especially in season 4. The most important thing which was poor was the dialogue or ""there was no dialogue at all""."
"Only the first couple seasons are good until Netflix bought it and ruined it. If you want to really watch this just watch the first couple seasons. It actually got cancelled, then Netflix bought it."
"If you want to know what a police force and a forensic team and a whole secret service organisation should never do, and would never do in real life, then watch this show! I have watched many escapism shows and intelligent heists (some even true stories) and this looks like an utter joke in comparison. It was entertaining but never believable. Particularly those gun fights and how they repeated the same plot twice. Professor charming the pants out of female inspectors twice? Come on! Where is the creativity in that?

Pedro Alonso, you carried the show all the way to the end and Berlin character was the best and most fitted to a role of a heist man of action. The charisma he added and also some of the most interesting quotes came out of the hedonistic character Berlin. Bravo Pedro. Salute!"
"This is truly marvelously entertaining

There are many basic, stereotypical themes going on, but they are performed so very very well.

It should be no spoiler whatsoever, this is about a bank heist.

At first glance, you wouldn't think you could make a couple dozen episodes about a single bank heist, each episode totally engrossing.

The story-telling here is simple, direct, and yet masterful. There is a different kind of psycho-chick for every guy to ogle, there is a psycho-intellectual for everyone into intrigue, and the over-arching story ... is a guilty pleasure to cheer for.

The character development sneaks up on you, ""Should I be cheering for the bad-guys?"", and exactly how good is the average ""good-guy"", you will pause to look yourself in the mirror.

As I am watching it, there is voice-over in English from original Spanish. You can tell that this is not exactly matching the required breathing and emphasis of the original talent, but yet it is of very high quality and very quickly you won't notice the discrepancy and come to associate with the familiar over-dub voice acting.

Right now I am well in to ""part 2"" or ""season 2"" as we would say, and it is late at night and I can't turn it off."
"I tried hard to fight back nausea, hoping to give it a chance. However the male characters are so unbearable, You're hoping the couple females will go movie theater with automatic weapons and give male characters torture due to them for grotesque behaviors. I generously skipped ahead to see if any improvements exist, but nope. Dont waste your time here."
"Fight scenes could be more realistic.

Nicely dubbed in english."
"This series has everything what you need but why the dubbing cast changed after second season!? Watching start of season 3rd was completely boring, these voices are not even near to the original one!"
I loved it however i was extremely sad when Moscow died and i hope there will be another season.
S1 and S2 were innovative and about the heist. While the later ones are about the drama and merry-go-round which makes absolute zero sense. Had given it 9 statrs for first two which has gone to 5.
"The series starts off well. The idea and the details in the beginning are well worth watching. Sadly, the creators only care for the HiFi and don't give a crap about the LoFi. Quickly the the characters become stereotypes from a Venezuelan telenovéla and the story evolves into something that more and more resembles a soap opera much like ""mi gorda bella"". At the end, I have to say I'd be scared as sh** if I lived in a country where during the biggest heist in modern history, the police was so reluctant to do their job that they felt the urge to go on a romantic date with a stranger and waste time and energy on lover's quarrels and jealous outbreaks. The fact that the robbers would be equally as disorganised and incompetent wouldn't worry me less. All of the people involved seem to be utterly incapable of prioritising, which is strange, seeing as they've spent weeks preparing for the heist... Bottom line to the moral seems to be: Real men are violent and know how to throw a punch. Women are emotional and irrational. Abortion is wrong. ..or maybe this is just the case in Spain..."
"It's strange that there are so few reviews. The series is really good! Wonderful plot, unusual incarnation, colorful acting. Yes, sometimes it vaguely resembles ""Ocean's 13"" and there are notes of fantasy and some oddities in the plot, but the creators do not pretend to be documentary. You can, of course, find fault with trifles, but somehow you don't really want to. It turned out to be a good quality feature film."
"Saw this title a few times on Netflix but never watched it until I could no longer hold my curiosity...

My only wish is I should have watched it sooner...

Character development and storyline unfolding is brilliant, as are the social evolutionary traits of the individuals in the gang. The chemistry between the actors is highly palpable and adds a great dimension to an already amazing story

I binge watched this until my eyes burned, at night i couldn't sleep and sometimes found myself sneaking in a new episode at 4 in the morning.. Simply amazing...

and oh...Nairobi, mi amore !"
Without doubt one of the best tv shows of all time. I have watched all 3 seasons in 4 days. I feel exhausted with so much excitement. Cannot wait for season 4
"I am just finishing season 2 and I don't get the hype. Acting is really bad, love story is cringe worthy and character development is really messy.

I carried on watching it to see if season 2 will get any better, but no."
"I only managed to watch the first five episodes. The plot seemed to be intriguing and I must say I liked it for the initial 20 minutes. Then it went downhill. I realised that it has A LOT of similarities with Inside Man, a quite good movie. But the characters are plain dumb. The dialogues even dumber. The interactions between robbers and hostages are a joke. It starts off promising and you kind of believe that you are about to watch an uprecedented heist. But it is everything BUT clever. And please, somebody answer an honest question: who is being kept hostage and asks for an abortion pill?? I mean please. Sorry, not worth my time. Cannot imagine what the hype was all about!"
The perfect plan with the most lucky unstable group. I don't understand why this series is so famous . I understand only kids .
"I don't even know where to begin, just 2 words 'skip it'"
"Seeing many of the negative reviews. I think people need to lighten up. Yes the show is crazy, ridiculous even but it's a load of fun. It's not a show that takes itself seriously. It wears its heart on its sleeve, has tons of ideas and energy. This is a cast and crew having loads of fun making this show and that's infectious to watch. Yes it's a soap opera in a way, but no more so than all those highly rated seasons of 24. People need to get over themselves getting so upset about it."
"I didn't watch season 2, 3, 4 and 5. I gave up after 4 episodes in season 1. Easily one of the worst series out their and definetely the most overhyped ever. Hello everyone? It was terrible from the very beginning!"
"Plot is far too contrived, the acting is weak and non of the characters have any bite, these are supposed to be hardcore career criminals! Whoever thinks this is close to reality has led a very sheltered or privileged life. I Stopped watching after two seasons as it had turned into little more than a soap opera."
"I really and truely do not get the brilliant reviews. You really have to suspend all logic, it may as well be sci-fi.

They lock themselves away for months planning this heist...and within the first hour they have manage to let a teenage girl get access to a phone and leave people unsupervised to run around the bank. Then going soft for captives.

Just ridiculous."
"Everything after that just dumb and really patronising to watch! The girls walk in after years of being on the hunt they walk in with their faces undisguised and nobody NOBODY recognises ""the most wanted"" in Spain?? How do you expect me to believe that? I stopped watching at that point! However, the 4 stars only because the first season was really good despite the ridiculous inspector pencil hair signature!

Finally, the best character was by far BERLIN! The guy was a natural at being a mafioso mob! He looked the part and acted the part! Outstanding job Pedro Alonso. Bravo! You carried the whole first & second seasons!"
This is definitely up there with the best series ever. It's an absolute thriller; you're always on edge. I watched it all in one sitting as I couldn't get myself out of the couch
"So, I started watching this show, admittedly, because of the hype.. And it just made me come to terms with the fact that just because a show has a lot of hype surrounding it, doesn't mean it's anything special.

Case in point : Money Heist is nothing special. I have seen countless films and shows relating to heists, and I admit that this show brings some sort of unique aspect to it here and there, but in reality that also falls flat after the first season. Since the ""heist"" basically repeats itself over multiple seasons.

However, to me the most annoying thing about it is the script. I'm sure it sounds way better in Spanish than it does in English, but if you don't understand Spanish, you're stuck with a very simple, uninteresting script. I know I could have watched it with subtitles and in Spanish, but to me, the flow of the series is lost that way. I think the translation could have been much better for viewers who don't speak Spanish. It clearly did not have a lot of effort put into it, to the point where the dialogue sounds limited and almost childish at times.

The police have to be the dumbest police ever at this point, they seem to be made a mockery of persistently. The self-proclaimed ""mastermind"" professor doesn't impress me either. None of the characters seem to have much depth or engaging storylines.

I think portraying the show to be so special and then being let down when watching it has really made me question what the general public find so ""special"" about it, honestly. I, on the other hand, was left bored.

It just seems like a cheap rip-off of Inside Man."
"Seasons 1 & 2 are interesting, there are a lot of twists and innovative ideas. Seasons 3 & 4 are lousy, I cannot believe how bad the script is! Maybe they ran out of ideas. The movie is overrated. Please don't waste your time with seasons 3 & 4, they get 4 or 5 out of 10. For Seasons 1 & 2 I would give an 8/10."
"Can't say enough for Money Heist, its a phenomenon. If you miss it, its your loss."
"I really like heist movies and I thought I was really going to like this show. I watched both part 1 and 2 and in the end this show proved to be a hit and a miss. Positives Most of the times it is entertaining if you don't take it seriously. Some of the actors are really good.

Negatives Huge plot holes. I will not mention all of them because it would take too much time. For me they completely ruin the main story. *** WARNING Spoilers ahead ***

The biggest plot holes resolve around the so called ""intelligent"" Professor:

Why does he tell Angel where he lives? Or at least, in the vicinity of where he lives. Because Angel shows up on his front door soon after that.

Why does he let Angel in his hideout??? This makes no sense whatsoever. Angel can not be sure that Salva is in the building. He could be out, he could have the wrong building. It is really easy to simply not open the door. Angel does not have a search warrant. Also at the same time there was a crisis in the heist so it makes even more sense not to let him in. Still, he lets him in and this allows Angel to take his fingerprint and test the cider. This decision causes the coma of Angel and also lots of suspicion from Raquel.

Why does he let Tokyo take part in the heist? She is completely unstable, cannot take orders or stick to the plan. She is a ticking time bomb and should be nowhere near a heist. Also why does she go back to the Casa after she was set free by the Serbians? A place surrounded with police, snipers and trained gunmen... By some miracle she is not shot (seriously, how can they miss her?) but she still ends up causing Moscow's death.

Why is he alone in the hideout? He hired Serbians but only uses them towards the end. The only smart way to handle the heist is to stay put in the hideout and let the Serbians do the dirty work like remove fingerprints from a car they used or dig. He should have also kept Rio with him in the hideout. The guy is a dead weight in the heist but is a hacker so could be useful working behind the scenes.

Why didn't he let the Serbians dig the hole further towards the vault before they even started the heist. Perhaps someone would notice the noise but i doubt it. Even so, he could have asked the Serbians to start digging again the second his team enters the Casa at the beginning of the heist. El Professor keeps saying that gaining time is key to the success of the heist. Focusing on digging seems obvious but again, this focus comes only at the end.

Why did he make Berlin the leader of the heist? He definitely has leadership qualities but he also ordered a kill of a hostage when there were many other options. Also, the guy is a maniac and litterly rapes a women on the show. El Professor keeps saying that the public needs to approve of the heist but that is difficult with a guy like him. (the character Berlin was a very interesting character played by an amazing actor and a great addition to the show but it just doesn't make any sense to pick him as a leader).

How did he escape to the Filippines? They know how he looks, he was even on TV. They could have easily closed the city streets. And as an extension, the borders/airports etc.

At the end El Professor says that his plan was perfect except for the fact that he fell in love with Raquel. But of course this is complete horse crap because his plan was ridiculsly flawed. It was actually a miracle (and bad police work) that so many of them got out.

The list goes on but you get the point. I can take a few plot holes to force the story to go from point A to B but in this show has a crazy amount. The show simply lacks realism."
"Today,after finishing the series, I decided to change my rating from 9 to 5. Altho this series starts well, the development of the plot and the characters is disappointing and towards the end it becomes completely unbearable. In the second part nothing makes sense anymore and the show feels like some cheap mexican soap opera where everything can happen. Characters change their minds, hating or loving each other every 5 mins, they do completely ridiculous things for no reason. The police on the other hand just sits there doing nothing.They tried to get in the building 10 times in the first episodes and then in the next 20 they just gossip in a tent. However the best thing is the ending episode. Even a 5 year old kid would have come up with something much more realistic. Such a shame."
"I would HIGHLY recommend to watch this. Reason

You would understand the ""WHAT IS PERFECT PLAN and HOW TO PLAN PERFECT?""

Special THANKS to Professor (Álvaro Morte) and Berlin (Pedro Alonso). Berlin you are the HERO. You could have stayed with team and blow the TUNNEL :(

Tokio is Brave girl with less brain :) Nairobi is Brave and Smart girl :) Denver is sweetheart guys... I think Monica took right decision :) Rio had a chance but he is a team player :) Moscow has PAPA respect :) Twin bro has endless bonding :) Raquel is supercop with kind heart :)

Rest all characters have justified there part as NO one else could do like them.

Respect for this team and finally... Bella Caio Bella Caio Bella Caio :) :) :)"
"La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) was a masterpiece! Until Netflix took over and created Season 2 (Part III & IV). Ending of Season 1 (Part I & II) was perfect, leaving audiences a bittersweet ending. But netflix ruined it by making a sequel and adding back stories from its original supposed to be good story. Look what happened to Riverdale - a total mess after the next few seasons. Please STOP...Just STOP making more seasons. I hope Part V would be the last."
"Now the final season is finished, i can talk about la casa del papel. Its a great TV Shows with some great moments: dramatic, funny, tense moments, action scenes, fantastic effects and with some lovely characters because we care for them. Im very satisfied with this TV show with the end too which i found the end very believable and i loved the way that they tried to let us think about something different at the end until the end that we understand what happened. I enjoyed all the seasons really. Maybe the third season in the beginning the TV show look very fan based. But i think in the middle part of the third seasons we can see some stuff very interesting. The season 5 was very good but i found that they developped so much some characters and the end of some relationship dont have an equal ending as a developpment. So i found some elements pretty rushed in the end but was not completely disappointed but i hoped more for example sierra and el professor but thats ok i mean. And the end what we can regret a little thats the end feel too much as an happy ending. But i can only recommend people to watch the seasons i fohnd a pretty great tv show that i wanted to watch over and over. Even if sometimes the tv show have too much spectacular scenes sometimes and it can make the audience more passive in some action scenes. But really a great TV show."
Yes most of the time the plot doesn't make sense because of over the top analysis of the protagonist. But still it is good Time killer. An overall nice breather and good concept for a show.
"While the plot is interesting, it also feels frustrating. It feels like it's being stretched to add episodes and seasons. The plot looks extremely fabricated and implausible, particularly from Raquel's perspective - the way she freely carry her newly founded boyfriend (Salva) around to critical investigations and police sites. Is Spain's law agencies really that dumb? And then Raquel is shown to have streaks of brilliance and out-of-box thinking and then she doesn't connect obvious dots, all to suit the vagaries of the plot. Circumstances always suit the Professor somehow. Would I recommend watching it - maybe yes but not for the brilliant script as the script has too many flaws that frustrate the life out of you at least once per episode."
"Just go for it.

The show is slow poison once you start it just go for it and try to binge watch it .

A season at one go and you will not regret it for sure."
It's overrated . Cops are shown dumb in both of the heists. They fell in the same trap again. Cops are rather helping robbers to escape. It's very unrealistic and illogical. Public are blindly supporting robbers. Cops are shown helpless most of the times . Nothing more than a time pass.
"If you enjoy bank robberies and the cat and mouse concept with brilliant story writing, this show is for you. I pulled three all-nighters as I couldn't wait to see whose game is ahead more turns (robbers vs cops).

Excellent all around! Made me cry and had my heart beating like crazy!

Can't wait for Season 5!!"
"Honestly...Once again extremely annoyed by negative reviews ...Why people feel the need to find logic in the entertainment...Looking for logic?Watch only Documentaries !!!Or sports,or music,don't judge action /thrillers negatively,just because of plot holes or whatever!!!If everything in films would be done according to real life logic.THERE WOULD BE NO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND WE ALL DIED FROM BOREDOME WITHOUT MOVIES!!! There are absolutely no TV series or ant other films,that can possibly follow the real life scenarios!!!Why??? Cause It would be very short and boring films! Somebody holds up a bank,police arrives,shoots or arrest everybody-THE END!!! So enjoy the art of cinematography for what it really gives you:some time to forget about miserable everyday life!And Money Heist is definitely one of the best shows in that regard!"
"I love this series. I've watched all the seasons and have never been disappointed. For a long time there was no such cool embodiment of the idea in life. You truly care about each character and don't know what to expect. I watched in one breath, I advise everyone to read this work."
"Watching series 3 and 4 of this show made me cancel my Netflix subscription. They completely ruined what small positives there were. Find this is happening with more and more shows.

We were laughing at the insanely huge plot holes and the un-killable Gandia.

Netflix are the true professors of the world, robbing everyone or their time and money."
I have never rated anything 10/10 in my life but after watching 2 seasons of this which itself is complete i would say that this show is the best show i have ever watched till date. I don't want to watch the season 3 because i am afraid it will be not as great as the first two seasons but i can't stop myself maybe this show has more surprises who knows!
"The holes in the scenario are SO many! There are things so unbelievable that it is obvious that are occuring just because the writers wanted to reach a predicament, they make no sense! First of all, the thieves leave the hostages alone all the time! Hostages try to help themselves escape in the most ridiculous ways, and no one hears them?? And all the while people are having sex with each other in there? And all the while the Police chick has time to go out on a date???

So very flawed it is hard to watch."
How the hell did this series get a rating of more than 8? Illogical story with so many plot holes and stupid characters to go along with. None of the characters are likable. One of the dumbest series ever. Stopped watching after 6 episodes as my head was exploding with all the nonsense being told.
"Great,loving,best....no words. I really into this series but i am giving 9 instead of 10 because of season 1 is not quite good as 2,3,4. But its great one. You really have to see this. And my best part is the character ""PROFESSOR"" woah!!! And my worst part is the ""ARTURITO"".?? And my intentions is not to criticize any character. Sorry for that."
"Poor Sesson 1 ..... ...unnecessary stretched up, could have been end it in 5 episode.... 5 to 6 episodes are enough to show all things in proper way"
"How stupid can a police inspector be? Watch this to find out. A robbery is a crime. You cannot glorify it. Stupid plot. Implausible. I watched the whole first 2 seasons by skipping ahead as 70,% of the scenes were full of cringe worthy emotional melodrama. Hyping up stupidity.

Can watch but don't expect logic and common sense.

Deserves at the most 6-7 ??"
"Ridiculous, unbelievable, boring ! Who cares of what happens to those thugs ? After 10 minutes, I was hoping they would all be killed. Stupid nonsense and waste of time. No interest at all. I really wonder why so many people find that contemptible story about contemptible characters...."
"It is a great non-hollywood european series. It is well paced, well directed, actors are selling their characters well mostly. It is a pleasant romantic fiction adventure, with a superficial revolutionary message which will make you probably have a good time if not biased. It is generally well done in most aspects, esp. If you consider that it is spanish. It's not a 10/10 and certainly not 1/10. What I mostly read here is bipolar reviewers based on their personal feelings which have to do with their expectations due to hype,or other things that have nothing to do with reviewing the show."
"Good things 1. Amazing acting from most of the cast. Especially the professor. This is what carries the show. 2. Some of the script. The clever ideas from the professor, like when they switch the masks of everybody so the two SWAT team guys cannot infiltrate. Also when they put a hidden microphone in the glasses of Angel. 3. Good intro song. 4. Great disguises of the heroes when they finish the heist. 5. Bella Ciao song.

Bad Things 1. It was nice one time when the Denver and Berlin pulled Guns at each other in the toilet, because Denver was in love with Monica. However, after that this trick of ""pulling guns at each other without shooting"" has been used sooo many times that it is too much. 2. Characters creating drama for no reason, just to make something happen or to help the plot. For example, when Tokyo suddenly pulls a gun on Berlin (Russian roulette), and then later Berlin throws her out of the bank. This was a very stupid decision from Tokyo, and no one would do that in real life. 3. Berlin Sacrificing himself in the end, when there was no need for it. They could just have gone in the tunnel and then blow it up. A person sacrificing himself is already a cliché, so when it is being used it must make sense and be very clever. 4. The SWAT team waited to storm the building until the LAST MOMENT when the robbers finished to print all the money. In the begging they were worried about hostages and in the end they didn't care. That is a very sudden change of mind from the police/government, which is convenient for the plot. I think that they should either storm the building right away, or not storm it at all to try and save the hostages. 5. When the SWAT team actually storm the building, we see the most stupid and unrealistic gun fight. Both sides shoot at each other for a long time and no one gets killed. 6. The scene with Tokyo is coming back through the main door on a motorcycle WITHOUT GETTING SHOT. That is just unbelievable and unrealistic. Even when the professor saves her from an armed police transportation, that is just too much. I mean these guys are already stealing 2,4 billion euro or whatever, but now they also have to be like superman/wonder woman and get Tokyo away from an armed police truck. Tokyo should not have been acting stupid from the beginning and then all that other stuff would not have happened. 7. Not everything has to be in the last second. Raquel gives the address of professors secret location to the Swat team, and they storm the place 1-2 minutes after the heroes escape 8. The scene where the professor smashes the coffee cup from grandmothers hand. If the grandmother cannot remember that, then how the is she able to take care of her granddaughter and herself? 9. Unrealistic portrayal of gunshot wounds. When Arturo and Monica get shot, they get a small surgery and in a couple of days they are okay. In real life, if someone gets shot in the shoulder or in the leg, they would probably take months if not years to recover. I don't know the exact timeline, but it is not a few days. You can google it if you want. 10. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they are the bad guys, so it does not make sense to just let them get away with the money to live in Paradise. Instead maybe they could have burned the money and give some sort of message to the government. It is like the movie ""Inside Man"" where they also rob a bank, but they don't take any money, they only steal some documents to bring down a corrupt former nazi guy. Or maybe they should just end up in jail, I don't know what exactly, but there has to be some consequences or some good-moral-reason-explanation to why they are doing it. Or else this whole ""resistance"" and bella ciao theme does not make sense if they just drink Pina Colada in the Caribbean. 11. Season 3, 4.



Other Notes
The relationship between the professor and Raquel has some similarities with Breaking Bad. Here I mean Walter and Hank.
The idea of giving hostages the same disguise as the robbers is from the movie ""Inside Man"""
"Childish plot, totally unrealistic and full of plot holes. Mr professor should give us the lottery numbers as it seems he knows everything before it happens. The perfect robbery is getting the money and escape as soon as possible. On this earth at least..."
"Great idea for story. Magnificent details that make you secretly smile. But let's be honest. There are huge plot holes, directing mistakes, unreasonable decisions and there are many times that even the smartest, behave like idiots."
"First season was great. It was a perfect mix of action and a little spanish drama. It was realistic. Police forces having their tactics that cought robbers of guard and they suffered loss and consequences. Unexpected releationships, hostages escape plans. It was lalal very New and unique to me and i watched it in 2 days. Then season 2 started which was slightly weaker then the first one. I Just started loosing interest more and more. Until the part where they finally escape, Season 2 episodes 6.it was a different show. Raquel turning sides and helping robbers gets out without consequences to finally meet her love again in a most cliche moment in a ""phone charger"" scene. Trained professionals feeling like a little kids with water Guns Just hiding behind shields, Without any tactic. Same cops not shooting robbers while lasers are clearly on them. Them shooting wall in a 1.5m height while robbers are crawling. Whole Scene with Tokio's and Rio's shootout with a cops is disaster. Like cops were told to not kill anyone at all cost. Tokio sliding and shooting better then 3 cops standing still behind covers made me sick. Even secretary uses a gun like she was borned with it in hands.

I like seeing characters progression in tv shows but here they dont progress, they flip personalities

The more i watched the more i was against main characters. It became spanish soap show like every other. Sci-fi spanish fast and furious spin-off.

Pointless."
"I couldn't take burning any more brain cells. Overly sentimental in manipulation. Overly dramatic by spoon feeding all the plot and emotions.

What is most astonishing is how many people like this."
I am disappointed you didn't do nothing in 4 season better that I didn't watched ...
"Loved watching first few episodes, and then! Such a unreal storyline.
People fall madly in love in 5 days.. willing to go to any lengths for love, including a police officer.
Civilians can fire guns like pros ( Monica)
The police can never hit a target but the robbers are pros
The list goes on and on. Gripping but completely ridiculous, unbelievable story line . Leave your logic in a corner, then you will enjoy it"
"Many people criticize the love drama inside, but in fact, the core of the crime drama is love drama. Love drama enriches every role, making them become flesh and blood rather than symbolic robbers, so we will stand in their position just like the people in the drama."
Enjoyable unique series. The acting is great and have binged watch all the 4 seasons within 4 days.
How on earth did it get such a score? What a joke...
"I started watching this show because a lot of my friends told me to do it. I was curious about all the hype, so I gave it a try. From the first episode I just couldn't keep away from it. The plot is amazingly good. Of course it's not something that has never been done before, but I believe it has never been done with this kind of quality.

Acting is on point, characters are unique and you can really connect with them, feel pity for them, hate/love them.

Of course this is all subjective but I can't really understand how someone can give a 1/10 or 2/10 to these series. For me this is the best series I have ever seen. You should definitely give a try and see for yourself"
", It is unfortunate to see this TV show turn into a business show, Part 4 8 episodes Why? A lot of the events like stuffing and stretching ... to see what the upcoming seasons will bring"
Why there is a hype about this sitcom? Professor looks more like soap opera conductor. Too long and boring stories each character. Love and emotions of every character is not required to build the story. I kept the TV on and went to sleep after about 4-5 episodes. When I got up it was 9th episode and the heist plot has not moved an inch. Waste of time.
If You Are New To The.. Just Watch This Until 2 Seasons. They are so good and much much much better than then the rest ones.. Dont go with hype and waste your time.. As soon as season 3 episode 2 starts.. It gets illogical AF.
This one pretty bucked up. Just stretching it somehow.
One of best series I've ever watched my advice is stick with it as initially I though it was boring and suddenly you make a breakthrough and see it for the genius it is
"Season 1 & 2 - ""AWESOME"" 10 stars Season 3 & 4 - ""AWFUL"" 2 stars

Great series. One of the best one based on a heist till Netflix made it its own and screwed it up. Season 3 & 4 is just an insult to the previous seasons."
Speechlessly bad!! Can't believe I wasted so much of my time watching the first 2 seasons.
"Although the tv show had everything needed to succeed, the greediness of the producers and netflix make the series a really ''one of many'' out there. Season 1 started surprisingly good and had everything needed for success: amazing plot, new actors, a different language, diversity, everything! And that's the reason it was amazingly succesful. Season 2 was good enough, not as the first one but nice to watch. Season 3 was the first sign that somebody tries to make money out of the dead horse. Plotholes, bad acting, people keep repeating phrases, irrelevant scenes...You could easily understand that something is going wrong. As for season 4...? I think it was the final shot for the tv show. Even more irrelevant scenes, huge plotholes, people reacting and doing things with no reason...

This is for everyone bothered to see this review. Start respecting your audience, don't treat them as money...Find out what your limits are!

4 stars, because you had an amazingly good 1st and 2nd season..."
"I don't know whats going on. I feel scammed by these ratings. It almost feels like somebody pushes the hype around the series just to get some good votes. To me this series was a complete waste of time. Too many plotholes, too poor of an excecution. Generell idea is good, but thats it."
"Idk why people are crazy about this show. It's been copied from the oceans movies and stretched like a rubber, they should have ended it with season 2 it is just like an ordinary soap opera excluding common sense having too much of melodrama."
"The first season of La Casa De Papel is a caricatured affair. In addition to its fine intro, and special breathtaking scenography, it is a series with a really thick and clichéd dialogue. The robbers have a desire to have the public with them, which seems stupid and naive, because after all, they are just a bunch of glorified robbers. The season is running in loop, with the abundance of sex and the fact that El Proffesor is constantly two steps ahead. The police are equated with puppets and incompetent, but at the end of the season, it is actually the police who are most in control. The action scenes are very dramatic, and with great caricature. The Special forces weapons sounds like the weapon on a combat helicopter.

However, it is a pulsating and lively series that dances to its own rhythm, and it must also have credit for that. We have to see what season 2 brings. 5/10 stars"
"Just finished watching season 5 and you guys have outdone yourself.
I thought may be it would not click this time...but I am speechless right now....and Tokyo "
Could not stop watching this series. What an excellent set of actors fully into their roles in a natural way. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Can't wait for season two
"I love the professor's references to Greek music and history, the script is excellent. It's funny and serious, clever and few times emotional... The dialogues between Moscow and Tokyo was truly intelligent but Berlin stole the impressions. The whole cast was fine except Arturito and Alison (they are annoying). All episodes are interesting, full of action and doses of mystery. I'm waiting season 3, i believe it's going to be as good as previous."
"I absolutely LOVE this show. I recommended it to people. Although some parts corny, it was full of suspense. Seasons 1&2 were best and they could have closed out the show there. Then comes season 3 and 4. Interesting but squeezing a little bit. Now comes season 5. I'm excited, like a kid on Christmas. To my surprise it was absolutely awful. I felt like turning it off after ep 1, however I thought it may turn around but the following episodes were worse and worse. Season 5 was a complete letdown. It was a mess, and I'm hoping part 2 of season 5 can salvage some of the damage. Terrific show, however as the seasons go on, and especially season 5, it begins to decline."
"Good until Netflix came with its paws and distorted the show. Interesting in the first two seasons, a new air on TV, until N came along and turned it into a current vulgar propaganda television series. I would have given it 10 stars if it had ended in season two, but now it's disappointing."
"What can I say about this show other than it's the best show to ever come out of Netflix. The heist of all heist the master plans of all plans. Amazing writing acting directing just everything. Just when you think you know what's going on , what will happen the professor will 180 snd have you constantly at the edge of your seats. The misfits finding family and overcoming the greatest of all grears. This show is one that will have us all believing anything is possible."
"I don't get the hype. The story has so many loose ends, so many plot holes that creators are trying to fix in same episode, the story and flashbacks are put in conveniece of creators and it doesn't even pay off loose ends. Like the unnecessary Rafael (Son of Berlin) storyline which doesn't do anything to stroy. Overhyed and Overrated by the masses."
"A well played roles by great actors shows hidden resistance messeges against the unjust system makes you feel the robbers have the absolute right to survive the police. Every single detail in this work has significant meaning Congratulations to the Actors, Writer and director and all the teams with all respect for what they produced. A10/10 is not even enough."
"Lacasa De Papel (Money Heist)

One of the best series that I had watched till date!

Their screenplay and character development are so much impressive!!!

Part 1 was eye opening. Part 2 was ice breaker. Part 3 was the reckoning!!!

Part 4 is coming in April 2020!!!

Currently available in Netflix."
"It is one of the best series in the world. Great storyline and acting. once you start to watch it, you can't stop. you can't sleep without knowing what's next. If you really want to have a good time, go for it."
"Events, details and changes in characters ethics are completely unrealistic"
"This show is plain DUMB. It is full of plotholes and stupid dialogues. Characters are annoying and utterly unprofessional. Their master is one of those i-knew-it-already and you-fell-into-my-trap whenever something goes wrong. The story is one of those StreetSide cheap novels where police is always dumb.

Go watch prison break and maybe you can see the difference between a dumb show and a good heist show."
I mean i have seen hundreds of series all my life and this has definitely made a place in my top 5. I mean each character did an outstanding job with the role . There are few things which are hard to digest but other than that it was a perfect one.
"Amazing series...perfection in every episode...watched it till episode ""Bella Ciao""...for me it was the best ending....gonna watch additional episode netflix produced."
Everything was until season 4 it feels director was on weed while directing this series.... Like wtf... Season 5 really even a immature won't direct like this.. a pregnant lady was overpowering professor and a Russian.... Hostage know how to use high loded gun n even know how to load them properly n even knws every gun like how it works. ??poor direction.
"Who watches this tripe? Seems to be episode after episode of love triangles, people shouting over nothing, ridiculous love stories and an extremely desperate police detective. It's so slow and boring, can't understand the high ratings.. don't get me started on season 4.. all the women are smart and the men/police absolute fools? Terrible representation of Spain's military and police force. Just terrible and the action scenes are all bullets flying around with no reason. Also, too many plot holes that I don't know where to begin.. don't waste your time."
Watch the 2 first seasons. 10/10. From season 3 and after the downfall starts. The last few episodes should get 0/10 are completely unwatchable. Do yourself a favor and stop after season 2.
#Boycott_Israel #Free_Palestine #SavePalestine #PalestineIsUnderOccupation.
I think money heist got extremely high numbers of fans from Pakistan. Love it we all do lots of love from Pakistan
"I have only watched up to three episodes, and I feel like I just have to review it already. There is no underlying message so do not attempt to look for one. The characters have zero depth, they are all one-dimensional and just full of themselves.There is no sense of realism between all of the underlying drama, and it seems as if they are trying too hard to portray intelligence and depth when actually the entire story-line is woven with denseness. I hope that they all get caught and imprisoned for life by the end of the series, but I guess I'll never know. If you find yourself relating to any of the main characters then, well then good luck, Charlie. :)"
"Script - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Been a while since I have seen a story so gripping.... i think the last was Breaking Bad that got me hooked. Amazing cast and superior screenplay/direction. after seeing this, i HAVE TO learn espanyol :-)"
"If you are a Hollywood super-hero movie fan, then you will not like this, the story line reflects a real life situations, ok some of the characters are dumb and behave erratically, but that also happens in the real world. For the people who rate this show poorly all i can say is, go watch spider-man or other movies alike. Can't wait for season 5."
"Yaeh ok, the idea was so nice, the thieves that steal from the money maker, nice. But, the characters were so poor and quite always they react impulsively, like Tokyo. And u will get to point that you are going to hate this chooses and tha unreal ones too. The end is a bit hasty, with no explanation and with a big cliche, like wow. There are too many scenes useless, with no point to be watched, just to ""make this episode longer"" and this make the watcher to skip them. Also there is a lack of plot, between the professor and Berlin, are they brothers or what? And is Berlin the kid who felt so bad when he was young? Probably we Weill never know. I ended this series becouse of the character of Berlin and the professor, they are the highlight part. The inspector character is like too round at the end, in just 5 minute she just changed all her ideas, let her daughter and went away. So realistic choices. I'm not going to advise this series to someone, too banal and in my opinion a bit bad, acting was good."
"Soap opera with forced storylines that make no sense at all, plot holes bigger than craters on the Moon and characters that are just doing whatever they want in a show pretending to be smart. Most unrealistic character for me after seeing just the few episodes would be that police negotiator. What were the writers thinking? She would be replaced after the first day of that mess..."
"Casa de papel is the most tedious boring series I have seen so far. The story rattles on all sides, the dialogues are uninteresting and unnecessary and the actor talent just isn't there. It is therefore a mystery to me why the story of Casa de papel should be spread over 4 seasons. Deserves no more than 4 stars."
"2021 was running dry of good movies and series. Just 2 or 3 good movies and series created a Tsunami.

Oh Tokyo I love you ??.

Last episode felt like you are shivering, tense, muscles and lips locked... Doses of 5 episodes was a smart and effective move.

Every Character are played so well by everyone. We Miss Berlin in the Museum though."
"I had to write another review.

This is insulting writing. / plot."
"There was a lot of respect, but now after your statements, and your views on the Zionists, I have retracted my opinion, you do not deserve the star."
Unintelligent Illogical Boring Cringefest clownfiesta of a series.
"A pregnant lady beats 3 men, seriously. We don't want to know about Tokyo's love life... More you watch it... More stupid it gets."
Just perfect ! a great plot. Amazing actors. And el Profesor ? so gorgeous !
"I loved this series so Much. It's Some of the Best Series I have Watched. It's full of Thrill, crime & Suspense. If you have not seen yet You should. The Performance are on next level. No Indian Actor can Match there Level. It's Just Great. Some Illiterate & Arrogant People Says that First 2 Parts are Good, rest are Poor but I Think all the Parts are Phenomenal. Really, the creativity of Spanish makers are Too Good. I Watched 4 parts in 10 Days only. I loved it So much."
One can see in a few episodes that the cops have the worse coincidences and the robbers the best of luck. The cop in a drunken drive only calls 2 numbers - both to his partner - which both dont go anywhere. He didnt know any other detective? The lady cop is beyond dumb to not notice what her partner told her and becomes an accomplice to the crime as he helps the professor.
Brilliant show - brilliant story - brilliant acting - i would say one of the very few shows that hooks you up like nothing. Let's hope the upcoming seasons are even better.
"I can count on one finger the number of shows that were good past season 3, maybe 3 that were good past season 2. I expected it to get laughable and it was."
"The actors snd actresses, the pace of the story... well done Spain, this is a great series. I will watch it again while waiting for n.3"
"Loved the acting, sound tracks and of course the suspence."
"SPOILER: Immediately after watching 2-3 episodes of S01, I started getting a feeling that there's something not right about this series. I didn't want to judge on spot, so I continued watching. The more I watched, the more it turned out to be as I expected, an amateur, shallow, and weak script, performed by not so interesting characters.

Berlin is good, but the others are meh.

So, this series about a robbery that has been supposedly planned for so long, yet you discover how foolishly it is managed and operated. Many times you see 5-6 kidnappers out of 7 in one room, and you wonder, who's left watching the 40+ kidnapped persons.

The operations room where the detective runs the rescue mission detects any telephone signal within a 30 meters area, yet the assistant manager had a voice recorded injected in his eyeglasses, and he's at the tent, but nothing triggers any warnings! It's not a static voice recorder, it's TRANSMITTING voice signal to the professor!

Lots and lots of simple and stupid overlooks like that make me question the capabilities of the director/writer/producer. I'm not a police officer or IT expert, but I mean it's common sense to consider such details.

It blows my mind to see such TV series and similar movie being rated 8+ on imdb. How? Just HOW?"
"First two seasons were really good to watch. season 3 : idea is already messed up. People who saved their life and their impossible plan worked want to risk their life and do it again. For which reason, for a stupid mistake. Season 4 : Writing was VERY BAD!!
Very slow plot u can find no advancement in the actions, 9 episodes just for dead member and returned member.
Writing is very unrealistic : love stories in a very serious situations as if they are playing or something, seems like they are doing these to feed episodes.
Those flashbacks were unnecessary,
BRAINWASHING!! : they force u to watch unwanted scenes, as they include interesting conversation in it. Brain dirtying !!
-unrealistic scenes : the security guy is immune to guns, wins against 6 people, when arturo got the gun from one the members and that secret member showed up the other member could easily beat him from behind instead he was waiting hah"
I'm highly recommended . Please watch and also say other. Waiting for next season.
"La casa de papel is a series with everything! It has plot twists ,a lot of action ,stress ,full emotions and above all passes good messages.

The only thing that keeps me from rating it with 9 is that it contains a lot of inappropriate scenes,and that netflix has put some characters who could have been somehow better ..like Manila..Also i would prefer not to exist so much throwback in the 5 season -volume 1- because it was a litle boring

i totally reccomend it to all of you !!!"
This is 100% the best Netflixseries i've watched so far! The actors are amazing and the storyline is insane. It also made me cry several times and I just CAN'T wait for part 5 :)
The show is too much overrated and dragged for a long time. The last season 5 is nothing but a shooting practice and slow mellow drama.
"If you like movies like the italian job, than this show is for you. The drama doesn't really go off track when it came to presenting a well planed heist. Although there were some predictable parts, the overall result was wonderful. The performances were, as well, top notch. Another plus about this series is that the pace is well managed, so, even though the events take place during the course of a few days, the audiance doesn't fell bored. However, I do feel a bit uneasy about season three, as the heist is over after season two."
"Nice story, awesome screen play, strong acting , especially the professer and Berlin characters"
"I'm not one to binge watch serials but this is a must watch! You never know what's happening till the end, twists and turns galore. The acting is top notch and I recommend watching it in Spanish with sub titles, just gives a better feel and gets you more involved."
"They say don't judge the book by its cover, but I did this mistake when I swa the image of this series and the title never attracted me to watch it till now but one of my friends praised it so much I gave it a try and I finished all 4 parts in 4 days, now I am not able to resist myself to watch it again, I loved it so much, Professsor, Tokyo, Rio, Denver, Lisbon, Niraobi, Hensikee are my so damn favourite. What we will do post 5th season,gonna miss it like anything.

Love from India."
"Season should have stopped after two seasons.

Don't understand Netflix on this one. Too often they have prematurely stopped series, such as Sense8 and Colony which had room to develop further, and here they went too far in the opposite direction,."
"The series seem to start with a good promise and a thrilling tempo but it never fully develops into something meaningful. The main storyline almost halts solely relying on the tension. The subplots are boring, unrealistic, unoriginal and slows the pace even more. It just swings from an unbelievable and unnecessary topic to another.

It obviously tries to extend the airing time with lots of filler moments and sadly filler episodes.

This is only good for those who are willing to buy the far fetched plot in exchange for nonsense thrills.

This show has very few surprise elements and it revolves around the same topics.

Just like the heist story , the TV show goes from awesome to disaster quickly."
"This movie is a MASTERPIECE. It has every characteristic of it: Good actors, great story, very funny, extremely emotional, you feel like jumping from joy, crying with them... Impossible to stop watching. Must watch !"
"Money heist, isn't a series ; It's an emotion. It is the first spanish web series that i have seen. Omg, what a wonderful series.

All character have been acted wonderfully.

Specially Professor, Barlin, Nairobi, Ric.

Love this Series ; this is the series that can watch again and again. I never feel boring watching this...."
"This is by far the greatest show I've watched I binged watch every episode and every season one after another. Stranger things was my original favourite but now after watching this it's definitely the best. The characters are what makes this show amazing, the professor being my favourite with all the tricks he pulls out his pocket are great. This is a very entertaining show, the English version was dubbed over perfectly, I've seen other shows with English voice actors and they haven't been as good as this. And I'm super excited for the new season that has just been announced. 10/10"
"This is one of the worst highly rated shows ever. It is full of plotholes and stupid decisions from the characters, if you want to watch a clever show, this is not it! The plot seems interesting, initially, but the further you watch the dumber it gets. Season 3 is a bit better but the whole series is not worth your time if you are looking for a quality TV show. Sometimes it is so dumb, I wishI didn't watch any of it! How is the ratingabove 8 is beyond me!? A lot of people have their standards these days very low it seems!"
"Seasons 1-2 are phenomenal but are more of a just-sticking-to-the-heist-only type of structure and having just about every part of the plan going well.

Seasons 3-5 imo are much better as it is a more exciting and bigger heist, with the way more of the art of a good tv show (cinematography, things being unpredictable, unreal acting, a wider variety of differ situations being explored etc). Without giving away any spoilers, seasons 3-5 land you, yourself in situations where you almost feel like only you are left to solve them and then the show comes out with something crazy which you wouldn't expect.

The show overall explores many themes such as crime, drama, comedy, romance etc. The point of this review is to let people know that those who say the last seasons are bad are those who only enjoy a show if they know what happens or only if they want to see a clean heist. The second heist makes the show very difficult not to binge watch."
"Suspenseful, funny, and action packed. ""Money Heist"" (La Casa De Papel) is a feast for the eyes and the senses. The cast is so well put together and the storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat."
It's one of the best series ever i seen! Every episode twist and twist. I enjoyed all seasons. Waiting for next season.
"I want to like this series SO much, I really do, but the silliness is out of control. The level of dramatic fanfare is like that of some action-packed anime. It's just so absurd.

If you had to sum up the premise of this series in one sentence it would be: ""Highly trained professionals break into The Royal Mint after months of meticulous planning, and attempt an epic escape."" That's something I can get behind! Unfortunately though, it's riddled with very corny and cheesy plot twists, and at times I want to throw something at my screen.

I would recommend watching Season 1 but don't bother going down the rabbit hole of this series. I'm on episode 6 of Season 2 and I'm really not sure how much more of this I can take."
"The excitement, drama, action and suspense of season 1 and 2 were intense and it should have been stopped at that, rating 9/10 Season 3-4-5 is just to bask in the glory of earlier seasons and almost repeating so no suspense nothing new 6/10."
I loved this series and watched over a couple days. Don't take too serious and you will find an exciting and original series. Only complaint for me was the English dubbing. wrong voices for most of characters and was pretty annoying. Would prefer to see the original with English sub-titles.
"The show starts with an interesting plot but then I found it unbearable to watch even after the 2-3 episode.
These characters were chosen for this mission because they were good at what they do and that the whole plan should go swiftly. In addition they prepared for months for this heist. However nearly all decisions are made stupidly and for no good reason. How come there is an affair for months among these 'clever' people, staying in the same house all together. 
Weren't they expecting some reaction from the hostages? Why try to execute the woman immediately after the incident and why didn't Berlin gave the mission to one of the muscle boys and started a family drama? (Weren't Berlin the one with good social skills.) And how can you even beat one of your own 'gang' members after a mistake; aren't they all supposed to be equals? The gang could be in fact clever but could had problems because the police chef is also clever or few of the hostages were witty to alternate their initial plans. 
I can go on more but in summary, I think the show doesn't deliver what it is promising. The only reason I am writing this review is the fact that it has 8.8 on IMDb and it is in my opinion overrated."
"Seriously there is nothing much to write about this series , but season 4 is something different as it is the biggest joke i have ever watched !! No way i still can not believe how they are gonna produce more seasons of this trash show ."
"Overall.. it just terrible.

they start with a great concept & a very promising story. then it starts going downhill... and it never stops, going down hil...

toooo many flaws in the storyline... too many loopholes... to many love stories between people.

I mean are you there to rob and make money OR are you here to make love stories and relationships?"
"I loved this serial not only for the good scenary and details that kept me tied to the screen I also appreciated the psychological evolution of the characters, how they started to attack one another despite being good friends before. And also the behaviour of the prisoners and how they can change opinions under threats. Congratulations! Its been long time since i have seen a good film"
Wow Wow what can I say about this creativity ... Now we can say that Season 3 is the strongest and most beautiful season in the series
"It was good first 2 seasons, Now they have destroyed it. It is a complete dieaster."
"Words just can't describe this awesomeness of this TV show. It is so terrific, on a level comparable to Breaking Bad, with EVERY actor delivering OSCAR rewarding performances making all characters both likeable, loveable and remarkable, something very, very special only few shows were ever able to accomplish.

This show just will blow your mind."
Finished all the part 3 episodes in a single day..Now waiting for part 4 finale...
"Its not bad and worth to watch but is higly overrated with the rating its shluldn't be more than 7,8. Like how is this serie 8,5 rating i dont get it"
Don't watch after two parts otherwise you will be regret. They ruined everything in part 3&4.
"It was bound to happen, you cant have material for 2 seasons and try to make it 5. It was good the first two seasons but they pulled a fast and furious because people would watch it anyway."
First original season (seasons 1 and 2) was good. Season 5 consists of a repetition of 20 seconds of action followed by 10 minutes of blah blah blah. The best example of how Netflix breaks TV shows.
"The show runners seem to be trying hard to add every usual element of your average group heist series/film, To mention a few: the extremely smart mastermind who plans everything ahead of time and foresees all possible scenarios and problems (same person also turns into a martial arts expert or an assassin, or a lover boy when necessary), the psychopathic group leader, the tough guy, etc. The problem is this team that the supreme leader gathers is so incompetent and unprofessional that a month long heist starts to go south on day one! And not for the right reasons too! On the other team, there is this super police captain who is so weak and incompetent she seems to spend more time solving her issues and fixing her own mess rather than focusing on a heist that caught the attention of the nation!

Enjoyed a couple of laughs watching season 1, but that's it for me!"
"Every character a masterpiece Each one,s character sketch perfect I finished all 4 seasons in one go binging without being able to stop Even though seasons 1 and 2 are the best seasons 3 and 4 did not let me down I have a hangover of the show even a week after binge watching is over The title song My life is going on and Bella Chow just enhance the beauty of this fantastic show Proffesor, Tokyo , Denver ,Rio ,Monica Nairobi and all the charecters so beautifully written and acted out I would give 100 stars on 5 from the inception ..writing to the final product Hats off to full team Cant wait for season 5 This is a must watch show according to me At some point while watching Money Heist it stopped being just a show and became an emotion"
"I would not say its the Worst show Ever, however not that great show for the Hype. I am sure Most of the positive Reviews are from Countries Like India or other South east Asian Countries who basically look for the ""Cool"" Aspect in a show and are new to watching Well scripted TV series... But trust me there are genuinely Well scripted Series out there worth your Time..."
"The only good thing about season 5 was Tokyo's death. From money heist this transitioned to war movie, with lots of gun shots and no casualties. This is highly unrealistic and disturbing. All season five was gunfire, I had to fast forward all the time."
I watched about 4 episode of this before giving up. The premise was good but it all quickly descended into farce.
"One of the best tv series ever, full of drama . amazing acting from all the actors and actresses. It's a must watch series. Puta Mierrdaaa"
I never write reviews for shows but this show surprised me soooo much sooo many times! Please please ignore all of the stupid bad reviews. I am not typically a woman that enjoys heist movies or shows so I didn't think I'd like it when a friend at work recommended it to me. It is full of action and has a great storyline. Cannot wait for April. I literally couldn't get anything done with my life while watching this show. Every episode seemed to end with a cliffhanger so I'd just go on to the next episode. The professor (over the heist) is genius and it is so interesting to watch.
"People complaint about the seasons 3 and 4 (which i never watched ) but i found nothing special with even the first 2 seasons The robbers were dumb , the professor was dumb to have a relationship with the inspector and how the hell was their asses saved?...coz the police were dumber ."
Total waste of your time season 3 n 4 never watch them...zero for these two seasons
"Its Very nice and creativity season 1,2,3 and 4 was very good , some people seen that should finish in season 2 but this serie is Incredible ! If this serie was American it's was taken an a 9/10 but because it spinch it take a low rate"
Many people has many reviews i have my own . HEIST was excuted very well .I must its far more better dan any other heist i have ever seen . thank you so much for this wonderfull story i involed myself in evry which way with this story
I would say this is great ... from the act.... to the tactics to the ideas ... to the music ... to the ending ... One of the best I have seen .... Bella Ciao
"This show is an unrivaled masterpiece. I want to give it a 12/10. I found it on a complete whim and was drawn in immediately. If subtitles aren't your thing, fear not, you'll forget they're even there halfway through the first episode. The acting is superb, the storytelling is insanely wonderful and the number of left turns this thing takes will literally make your head explode. i can only hope a part 4 is in the works. I want more and more and more of this, please."
"I just watched the last episode, and i feel a bit speechless. This is a series with twist and turns, and you never know if the professor has planned the events or if it just goes horrible wrong.

Slowly we are brought in to the plan, and how it became. And learn more and more about these robbers. And what a ride it is.

I would recommend watching it in the orginal language, because the dubbing is horrible. I dont understand a word they are saying, but its great. (Its texted) The dubbed voices seem like they did not grab the essence of the series, and just seem off. You can do better NETFLIX! Disgrace to this awesome series.

Series: 10/10 English dub: 0/10"
"Total waste of time .. Boring... S01, 02 was best , but further Sessons are worse."
"Well what a let down .. first 3 seasons were good... after that it just went downhill. And Part 5 was painful to watch to be honest.

And if you watch the behind the scenes episode after it all finished in Part 5 All the actors and actresses did was complain .. complain... complain about the scenes, the dust,they were tired.., Talk about a bunch of amateur divas."
If i had such annoying hostages i wouldn't want this hesit no more
"It had a nice plot, great characters and it became more and more impossible to watch. Season 5 is total garbage, 1 star."
"The premise had lots of potential. A well planned, carefully thought out heist the likes of which Spain (and possibly any other country) has ever seen.

Unfortunately it all starts to fall apart when they carry out the plan. Highly unprofessional criminals, stupid hostages, and an amount of drama that would rival any South American TeleNovela."
This is the most addicting series i have ever come across. If anyone has a slightest of interest in Suspense/Thriller/Crime then this is a go-gun for you. This series deserves everything appreciation and recognition
"Liked the web series. watched all four seasons. My favourite character is the professor, such an intelligent character. Now waiting to see how they will get out from the bank."
"It was ok for about a season and a half,but then they just started recycling stuff to make the show last longer,and they aded some weird superhero fearures to the charcters. In the end I started hating it because it was so overhyped."
"Season 1 and 2 rate - 8, Season 3 and 4 rate 1. Especially season 4.nothing really happened. 80% of time they talk about past and 20% is actually action and story goes on in that time. Too bas for the series. It was promising"
"Following same strategy as others.once become hit need to drag it and making it worse Professor average actor his wife is a disaster..remove that old lady from this...sentimental drama in between ...arturo,angel,Moscow what kind of actors are these....worse really worse....so many other seiries are better than this ...so fortunate they are to be on top which is not deserved"
"Two first seasons are 9/10, 3rd one is 7/10 and 4th one is 4/10, I know on avarege it doesnt give 8/10 but i usually take the better seasons more into account then the bad ones when giving a review to a tv show."
"What if Die Hard delved into the personal lives of each of Hans Gruber's henchmen? And what if those henchmen were idiots who couldn't handle their emotions in the middle of a complex crime? Why did the Professor hire these clowns? Tokyo should have been executed by Berlin after her first of many dangerous mistakes. This show has a great story but the characters do not react to events like normal people. Plus the English subtitles are straight from Google Translate, really clumsy."
"People are saying the first two seasons are great, THEN it goes downhill? I barely made it through the third episode in S1. Tropes are trotted out so fast in this series that it's hard to keep track of. Female detective lead is the only one with personal baggage? Helpless ambassador's daughter goes into a bathroom stall with dumbo jock expecting...what? Junior heister takes hostage into the master control room to have her record a denial video on her personal cell phone, then leaves her unattended while he fights with his non-girlfriend heister accomplice? Rejected pregnant mistress plans to get an abortion, yet wavers instantly when the weasel father confesses what a shyster man he is. Said weasel then gets said mistress to go grab a stashed cell phone, immediately putting her in danger? Is this for real? The real horror is that this goes on for 5 seasons! Nope."
"I dont understand why people are talking about this show so much. The story is bad, the acting is bad, and it is impossible to identify with the characters, because they are constantly behaving unnatural and stupid. And please fix the english audio dub on netflix. Its just horrible!!"
"This is mainly for people who watched all five series.

Yeah, parts of it were fun. But in part five, I just wanted it to end. They dragged it out with all those ""back story"" segments for no good reason. I eventually fast forwarded through all back stories. I even started fast forwarding through the stupid love/sex scenes that dragged it out. It's the kind of series you watch that you gotta be careful about recommending to family members, for fear they will think you're nuts.

Would have been better if they'd cut everything in half."
One the worst series i've seen. I don't really understand the success. It's just a terrible soap opera
"The first 13 episode was extreamly good, but the last 6 was the oposit. its ok, the first part has some big mistake

spoiler

like the professor portrait scene with the russian, but the serial is good, i give a chance and was unstoppable to watch an other episode.

but the last 6 episode is just annoying. drama, drama, drama, the jokes are missing, the pro robbers become amateurs. the episodes become lame, like all the convesations. talk talk talk, but nothing interesting.

poor serial. :( li"
It should have ended at season 2. But the producers and Netflix wants to make more money. Season 3 and others are more like fantasy or fairytale kind of story. Time wasting.
I won't give anything away but this is one to watch I binged the entire two seasons in a week each episode is better than the last my only tiny gripe is the English audio dubbed over the top but after a few episodes in you don't notice I can't wait for season 3
If you want to see a show which is completely illogical the go for it
Superb!!!Very well made show.Acting is just absolutely amazing!!! Some plot holes and illogical things do not prevent it to be one of the best tv shows ever made!
"An epic series with intelligent script and intriguing characters. Amazing action keeps you focus in every single episode. This series have it all. Love ,hatred, action, suspense ,touchy and funny moments. A different action series with great interpretations from all the characters, many symbolisms about capitalism and socialism, ""bad"" and ""good"" people, awesome soundtrack and of course very intelligent scenario.

The negative for me is Netflix touch who launch LGBTQ messages in every single series even if it doesn't suit to the script."
"It's so disappointing how the cast showed up at the most oppressive country tv show, Israel (the stolen land Palestine). Definitely you just lost a fan!"
This show is highly overrated. It does not deserve the high ratings. At first the concept seems interesting which is why I gave it a chance. But the story is unrealistic. You forget that the heist has only been taking place for 5 days with how quickly everyone falls in love and how quick gun shot wounds seem to heal.
What the ruddy f is this bunch of arse about? Godawful dries.
"Since long time, I noticed that Netflix tv show has high good rating here , but i said it's a different opinion, but after this show i'm sure that most rating is fake.. so don't depend on it."
"It's a show that started out great and later descended into the same dramatically sentimental and unrealistic abyss as Fast and Furious. It should have ended at season 2, then I would rate as a solid 8 but the following horrible seasons pulls the score down."
"Sometimes in your lifetime you come across some shows that you want to hold on, this was one such show.

In the final season director has outsmarted every one, Why the professor became a thief, and the way he finally achieved his goal , a perfect way to classify each and every character is the hallmark of this show.

"" Must Watch """
"This show is awesome. Thriller, crime drama and a little bit of root for the bad guys."
"The story revolves around a man who came up with the perfect plan to rob the Mint of Spain.

He hides this name of his and reveals himself as the Professor, but he clearly cannot see himself alone. He gathered experienced criminals who already had nothing to lose, and worked out his plan with them for six months.

They were ready for anything, but in the end they did not have time to leave in time and closed themselves inside. The building was surrounded by special forces and crowds of policemen who are sure that the criminals have nowhere to go and they have to surrender.

An interesting Spanish detective incident related to the robbery of the country's Royal Mint for a couple of million euros. Well-constructed psychological-thriller line, acting effectively, simultaneously realizing many events."
"Bunch of people stealing public money, looting from common man in resturants and other places, putting so many innocent vicitm in hostage situation and they want to be treated as hero.

If professor spent 1/2 the time planing how to reform the country by legal ways, he could have done much more. Instead they took all the money for themselves (maybe distributed few cents to dollar on the street, but that is cents to dollar) and then left common man to pay heavy taxes so that government can recover all the money lost."
"Characters are changing faster then the light moving thorught the universe, unable to track the logic of them and all because of LOVE. That's not a heist movie, it is a romantic comedy of stupidity. I really like the heist part (1/10 of the movie) and it is incredible, but the truth is that Netflix is trying to highlight one part and forgets about the other, too much plot holes, too much drama, too much values that are not in the right place at the right moment of time."
"Don't let the good score and reviews fool you.

La Casa De Papel IS NOT about a heist. La Casa De Papel IS NOT about their plan. La Casa De Papel is just another teenage drama speaking spanish rather than english.

I love the european cinema. It always calls my attention because contrary to Hollywood, I have the feeling they always try to innovate their formulas, and La Casa De Papel is no different.

As I mentioned, it's a teenage drama. And yes, it's innovative because of its heist background-a merit I can't deny.

But don't get me wrong: their innovativeness fails in every aspect but the innovation itself.

Characters are all dumb, including acting-except Berlin,-omnipresent plot holes, stereotypes everywhere, and the problems they face aren't intelligently or logically resolved.

Most of the solutions are improvised-despite the months on planning to actually perform the heist,-gambling-based, or poorly developed. When they can't think in something that doesn't fit any of these categories, there's the last resort: a very stupid, irrational bi-polar character called Rio which is the xXYoung_HackerXx that has the superpowers of create bombs, bypass any security system created by the most advanced security companies of Spain, go to the gym and shoot with guns-all this alone, by the age of 19 and at once! The new McGayver is Spanish!

If you like a teenage drama, go for it. It really has the merit of entertain, but hardly fails when it comes to seriousness. If you are looking for a detailed, well-executed with great acting heist piece, just forget it. There's no brilliance here. At all. And oh, the ending is just... bad. Predictable to say the least."
"Promoting thieves and criminals in the name of liberalism and communism.

Bogus, pathetic, cheap."
Genuinely haven't a clue how this mess of a show became this popular.
"You've heard of the difficult second album; here is prize example of the difficult second series or rather the second series that should never have been made. Everything that made both parts of series one so watchable and gripping is missing here. This goes from long boring scenes where nothing happens and there are sheaves of tedious and unnecessary dialogue to the absolutely ridiculous, Two of the men looking for a trained killer who has vowed to murder them are distracted because they are spending time discussing ex girlfriends. And then when the killer turns up four of the ""heroes"" fire off hundreds or probably even thousands of machine gun bullets directly at him from close range and he walks away. Maybe he had on body armour but on his legs?! The 4 stars I have awarded are 8 for series one, 0 for series two."
"Well, kinda like a gossip girl heist movie combination. Nothing makes much sense. A bunch of boy's and girl's scouts bank robbers outgunning the military and along the way open a well-run hospital during their gold melting enterprise. A quintessential 6-pack movie. Dialog can't decide if we want to be really stupid or just pretentious.

Camerawork is good, production design. is good, acting is good, writing is 'smart and braindead'. First two seasons are fine, then Netflix bought it and from then on with a big money injection and hundreds of thousands spent for public relations it goes downhill quickly and endlessly repetitive."
"Heard good reviews about season 1-2 and indeed it's good. Berlin acted very well.

Season 3-4 too unrealistic and absolutely trash. Do not waste your time..you've been warned."
"Casa de Papel is a very good TV show overall. I really enjoyed it. The plan of el profesor, the narration by Tokyo, the relationship between characters. The two first seasons was very great. The third season, at the beginning, i felt that become more a fan base but when you watched it all the season it still have some great moments: mysteries, suspense, dramatic, funny, psychological moments. I recommend this Tv show. It was a very good experience overall. The season 4 have still some great moments and the end want to see the season 5 for sure."
"Absolutely unrealistic screenplay, annoying acting of Ursula Corbero as Tokio, a lot of stupid actions for so ""professional"" bank robbers."
"I really can't understand what does one find in that show. Sloppy, full of voids and silly politics..."
"Its the best money heist series ever !! Incredibly acting , tension level is high & it will explode adrenaline in your veins !! The script is magical and unexpected"
"Simply great, watch it and accept to lose real friends because you watch day and night. Get yourself sucked in so hard that the main chatacters become your new friends and feel sorry if you lose them too. Divorce your wife because you fell in love with Tokio and search desperate for something else to watch with similar content - or actors. Oh well, just watch it again - nobody will know since by now it's only you and the TV."
"Plot holes, terrible writing, ridiculous characters. Absolutely overrated"
"It starts with a strong note, a good story and great characters but soon it starts falling down from reality to fiction and filmy story.. I would have preferred if they had stuck to the original story of a brilliant perfect plan and conquering obstacle instead of over using the Stockholm syndrome to a level where even police would start to help them. By the time the second season ends, I just wanted to quit watching it but I was hopeful it would get better. It didn't. Somehow it convinces you by the end of the show that robbers were good people and the police was bad in trying to save the people. I don't know why they wanted to glorify the robbers and showcase the bank robbery as a great revolutionary thing. None had done any great service to anyone by robbing the mint. Who were they fighting against and what was the resistance? It turned from a brilliant series to a extremely stupid one in a very short time. I still don't know what the craze is all about."
"The first two seasons of this show are so good. Absolute must watch. The show should've really ended after them though. Or maybe after a ""Where are they now"" mini season. All of the characters had their arcs finished and the ending was all around satisfying. But Netflix saw that the show had become a global phenomenon after they had bought it, and decided to make a few extra bucks by continuing the already finished show by making three big budget seasons.

Netflix's decision probably paid off for the actors and Netflix themselves, but the show's quality suffered a lot from it. What was originally a 9/10 show turned into a 7 or 6 /10. The writing got a lot worse, the show got turned into more of more of a action show compared to the first two seasons which were more of a thriller (which originally made it so good), and there was nobody to fill the void after the death of the charismatic Berlin. Although Netflix really tried to fill that void with Palermo, they did not succeed at it. He is just inferior in every way. Also Murillo's successor Sierra is nearly not as good and relatable of an inspector as Murillo was.

After finishing the show yesterday I can say that the last three seasons had some emotional and good moments, but they still fail to outshine the well written and thought out first two seasons. Netflix didn't ruin the show completely by any means, they just made it a lot worse by continuing an already finished story."
"Season 1 was good and somehow plausible, but I pushed myself to finish season 2; and I'm absolutely not going to watch the rest as the writer/writers insult their audience by considering them gullible and/or action-junkie imbeciles! The following is just a few instances of what's wrong with the series:

1. Abusing the song Bella Ciao to glorify a bunch of murderers and criminals as heros! Partisans fought for their country, its people and freedom, they didn't fight for their personal gain/money, they didn't take innocent people as hostages and mentally (and quite often in the series, physically) torture them! 2. Raquel was supposed to be the best chief of police in Spain and yet she was too stupid to take the guy somewhere out of the town to interrogate rather than arresting him right away! She was also too weak of a character to shoot him when she was given a second chance -in the legs, for instance- and let him drive off in her own car! 3. Angel lost his faith in the system in just less than 5 minutes? Monica risked her own and others' only chance of freedom over a stupid crush? What was the significance of the scene Nairobi boosting Alison's confidence when she was a passive hostage throughout S1&2 and not showing any courage? Was that merely a filler, like many other unnecessary scenes? 4. Is the Spanish police force this incompetent, for real?! They couldn't shoot Tokyo's motorcycle all the way she was driving through! 5. The police had several opportunities to infiltrate through the ceiling without breaking a glass or making any noise (e.g. cutting the glass at night like in Mission Impossible movies); even during multiple occasions of noisy exchanges and events when the heisters were distracted! 2-3 rangers could take down 5 criminals, especially if finished them quietly and separately (as they were scattered across the place most often), given that Oslo and Moscow were down, or when Oslo was gone and Tokyo under their custody. Moreover, the characters are not charismatic and definitely not loveable! Do the writers seriously expect people to root for/relate to any of them?"
"The concept behind the show is quite captivating, and seasons 1 and 2 were thrilling, and deserving of a 7.5/10. However, yhat's were the story rightfully ends. Netflix had no business bringing the show back for more seasons, as it showed when season 3 aired last year. With nothing brand new to add to the story, they just recicled the premise and format from the first two seasons. SPOILER ALERT: Killing Nairobi off in season 4, one of the few characters that actually motivates viewers to keep on watching every episode, was a horrible mistake (kudos to Alba Flores, by the way, marvelous acting)."
"Where do I begin? Started watching mainly due to the very positive reviews and high scores given to this serial.

My opinion -

The basic heist uses a storyline used before many times, as early as 30 years ago, where the hostages would be made to dress up as the criminals to evade arrest.

The acting was amateurish overacting, at best. A high school could probably put up a much more professional production.

There was zero suspense. It fails to grip. I'm comparing this to a serial like 24, which I was unable to switch off as it had me on the edge of my seat !!!

There are far too many intermingled story lines that waste a great deal of time.

Watching this is almost akin to watching grass grow !!!

I honestly cannot understand all the high scores given to this.

In short, the ongoing pandemic situation around the world has us homebound with nothing to do. You probably can't do much worse than this."
"We loved the first 2 seasons. Season 3 was OK. We stopped watching after a few episodes of season 4, slow, unlikely and boring."
After Season 2 the story keeps on going in circle of action & emotional rollercoster. It doesn't keeps the Heist look original but made it look like a drama.
"At most on a level with shows like Prison Break, rather below it. There are just too many better shows than this to justify a 8.6, seriously."
"Too many political correctness clichés (strong wamam, meanies bullies etc ...), a Netflix show bringing its political agenda to Spain. Anyway the real problem is that the show could be great but it is heavy flawed and get dumber every passing episode. It is a problem because the plot has a real huge potential. Basically the plot is based on the very elaborated plan of a mastermind (the professor) to rob a bank... great.... but he choses the worst people for the job (psychopath, hysteric girls etc ...). Eventually it doesn't make any sense."
"I watch whole 2 season in a single go. Before I start, I saw some people rate low this series. I honestly highly recommend other not to consider negative comment. If this series isn't best then no series will be good than this.

Anyway, heist planning and making and acting all was tremendous. I enjoyed every piece of episode. Director knows how to make TV series. I have been always fan of crime, thriller and twists. This series was perfect for my taste. No other series can beat it. I liked Breaking bad, Game of thrones, The sinner, Dark but La casa de papel (Money heist) is exceptionally good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. Worth time spending on this show.

One more thing, this is a TV series not a true event. I know something which can never be done in real life, but who cares. May be it can be. However I enjoyed this show very very much. And I want to congratulate all actors and directors and all production crews. Mind blowing job guys. Keep it up! and Make this type of TV series more and more.

I am still very much excited :D Many many thanks for my heart."
So much overrated and people are making totally nonsense hype of this show.
Netflix paying the reviews. Waste of time. Unrealistic.
"This series is a complete package. With very good script, direction and acting this series makes you feel emotions of every character. I have seen few more heist movies but this is untouchable. Liked professor and Berlin's character the most. Tokyo was irritating at places."
"... And a spit in the face of every fan of the first two seasons. Can't believe how childish and stupid this has become. Don't waste your time on season five, if you want your IQ to drop by 60% start hitting yourselves in the back of your head with a hammer, it's less painful than watching this, and the result will be the same."
"It used to be great, now it is just a sad story. And the story isn't even finished."
"Maybe the good reviews are about the basic premise of the story, which is interesting and carries the series. But the scenes are so implausible, and the script reflects how little the writers/showrunner know of real human interactions. What makes it so much worse is the ridiculous misogyny. I see they have a couple of women writers, but it's mostly men, and it is absolutely laughable. I feel sorry for the women writers, it's never easy being a minority in a writers' room."
"Lousy script, lousy actors, a mediocre serie that became trendy thanks to a very undemanding audience."
More than worst. Just a fckng waste of time. Dont waste time watchinf this just watch 'Spartacus' and you will be amazed by seeing.
"This is the best, I like everything.But I wait for part. 4 to end this.NO SPOILERS"
"This thing just turned into the most ridiculous thing I have watched in ages...A toddler could have written a better story...I mean hell even Lost made more sense...this just went from semi realistic thriller to superman meets batman and john wick...A monkey with a suit shooting an M4 will hit more than this guys...obviously your now bullet proof wearing cotton cloth...great job in turning this into crap in matters of minutes. Just do your self a favour and don't watch S3-4, it will just ruin the whole thing...couldn't watch it anymore after the scene where people shoot about a million rounds on an uncovered target and he doesn't even get as much as a scratch...maybe nuke him next time? Just hope you dont bring back more seasons of this because this thing is officially ruined..."
Two seasons for Mint of Spain and two for Bank of Spain. The characterization of the professor was excellent. Very intelligent. First two season were excellent and remaining two could have been better but the twist at the end of season 4 is good. Eagerly waiting for season 5.
"The plot is considerable to the core, contains twist in ending of each episode. Also , the acting is strong enough to the carry out the role."
I can't fathom why people are hyping it. Its plain dumb and boring after 1st episode. Story is full of plotholes and devoid of logic.
"Big mistake not to finish after the first heist. After the first heist, it was just a tiring back and forth between past and present and completely unrealistic."
