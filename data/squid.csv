"I honestly don't know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane. At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didn't do it for me chief...."
"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles."
"I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting."
"Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.

However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it."
"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""

The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.

As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long."
"After hearing about all the hype and seeing it was one of the most watched series in the entire world I finally found time to watch Squid Game. I have to admit that I had fun watching it and was very entertained throughout the entire season. It's about hundreds of contestants (who are all down on their luck and need money) that are asked to play children's games for an shot at winning a lot of money, 45.6 billion won (about 33 million dollars). The only thing is these children games are now all deadly and the last contestant standing wins all the money. It will pull you into its world and before you know it you'll be hooked. It's a thriller with lots of twists and lots of violence. This is a show that will stay in your mind long after you watched it. I know it's already been renewed for another seasons so I hope they can keep the same magic they had for season one."
I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.
"*light spoilers of plot details*

Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.

Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.

But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.

Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.

There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.

Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.

If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two."
"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful."
"Squid Game is a show that will stay in your mind long after you watched it. After reading all the great reviews and seeing it was one of the most watched series in the entire world I finally found time to watch Squid Game. I have to admit that I had fun watching it and was very entertained throughout the entire season. It's about hundreds of contestants (who are all down on their luck and need money) that are asked to play children's games for an shot at winning a lot of money, 45.6 billion won (about 33 million dollars).

It's a thriller with lots of twists and lots of violence. I know it's already been renewed for another seasons so I hope they can keep the same magic they had for season one."
"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.

Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three."
"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.

Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.

I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6."
I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.
"This show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.

And then the VIPs came in.

Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.

However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?

And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, ""Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""

Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.

I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.

I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, ""This is one of the best scenes in TV history."" I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.

I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end."
"Decent set deco .

Battle royal flavors.

A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.

Very bloody and gory at times.

Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea."
"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb."
"Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!

But things went downhill a little bit each episode. By episode 4, I was totally over it.

I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it.

Didn't really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film."
"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful."
"So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that."
"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.

After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.

So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.

Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!) There were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.

And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.

The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.

Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?

The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.

The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.

The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.

After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.

They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.

See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending."
"What is going on here? How can this show be praised like it is? This series is positively garbage...

It's first degree from A to Z, the writing and acting are deplorable (oh the rotten discussions on the meaning of life!), the message distressingly banal, if not non-existent. Manichaeism in all its glory..

The choice of music (Blue Danube from top to bottom) to emphasize the decadent atmosphere is pathetically heavy too. I really don't understand what people can find in this interstellar piece of trash that looks like it was written and directed by an 8 year old child, considering how subtle is it.

Nothing is credible, everything is predictable, the characters are caricatures (OMG, the ""VIPs""...)

What's the so-called great political and social message? That people will do anything for money? That's the great originality of the thing, seriously?

I haven't seen anything that ridiculous or grotesque for a long time."
"Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored."
"This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character's morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of ""rich people watching"" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular."
"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out."
"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?

The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.

Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.

I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.

I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?"
"The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I'm only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing.

I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting.

The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970's.

Two more attempts then I'll give up."
"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!

Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget."
"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.

Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.

In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be."
"First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes ""Kamisama no iu tôri."" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.

Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.

Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from ""actors"" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.

Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring."
"This series is so overrated. But let's be fair, it's a very good series. I've watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it's a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come, I hope it doesn't fall into ""La Casa De Papel"" status."
"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.

Examples (spoilers!)

1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.

2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!

3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.

4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?

4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.

5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.

6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.

7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?

8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.

9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.

10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.

11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).

And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes."
"Very compelling opening episodes, but when the actual plot unravels it makes you go, ""Oh, that's just it? That's kinda lame"". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10."
"This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It's a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You'll understand why.

And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).

Overview: This series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It's very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.

The Good:
The idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of ""Hunger Games"" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.



There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It's not the best character writing but it sure did the job.



The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It's all great, it's what the series is meant to do.



The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn't do it for me).


The Bad:
The main character is kind of ""stale"" to me, it's not really someone I'd care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It's not about the actor, but the director didn't really get so clever about managing his MC's façade it felt flat.



It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there's not much to see after that.



It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That's what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn't sign up for, nor did we want.


The Ugly:
Remember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven't seen him die but something about the entire side plot should've happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.



VIPs: This is a grand ""kek"", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drink
Nothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn't buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that's not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.



Last game is a buzzkill: They should've come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.


The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn't help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.

All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it's still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever."
"This country is already done if this is the greatest show of the year. This is cheap and lame, and if this is what is entertaining to people, I really fear for the future."
"Everybody has been talking about ""Squid Game."" I've been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn't feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don't watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched ""Squid Game"" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it's meh.

To me it's a Korean ""Hunger Games."" I know that there are some big differences, but it's still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we're all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.

Maybe it's a victim of its own hype, but I wasn't that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn't want to be in, but I will say that some of the 'umph' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I've labeled this spoiler so I'll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it's a dead giveaway that they're going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.

So, to ""Squid Game"" I say ""Meh."" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn't interest me enough. If ""Squid Game"" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would've been a lot better. That being said, I'm committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two."
"Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.

It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.

Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.

So, overall, 7 out of 10."
"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.

The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.

And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas.... The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the ""plot twists""/reveals so typical... I felt like I've wasted my time with this series...."
"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.

What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.

Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.

Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.

The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.

Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content."
"Watch the first episode if you can't resist the marketing hype. You'll see it's a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it's heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I'll give it a 1.

Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash."
"This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.

The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?

Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring."
"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.

If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.

As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!"
It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.
"Squid Game. Wow.

Korean.

Best description? Uncomfortably genius!

(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)

I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.

Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!

They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.

Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.

And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.

If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*"
"This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre."
"Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.

The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
"Squid Game

A very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.

Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.

The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.

We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.

Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!

The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.

The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.

Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.

In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".

The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.

Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.

Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!

I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.

I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers."
"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.

It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.

So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people."
"Very disturbing with grotesque violence. Poor acting, poor story. Why that hell were the 'supposedly good guys' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, with all the grotesque violence and a poor ending. The main character only went back for the money, he knew in order to win others have to die. But now, he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings - you cant have it both ways mate!!!. Please save your time and life and don't bother watching this show."
"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.

Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me."
"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche."
"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)

i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movie

overall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.

Things that bothered me (without spoilers)

-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything

-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene

-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me

-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged about


the games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck


-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?

-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.

-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next."
"A drama that works as a critique of wealth disparity, with hundreds of desperate people brought together on a mysterious island to compete for a big cash prize, not knowing what the games they are about to play will entail. When they do understand it, we see some of the inevitable behavior from a group of people under great stress, including violence towards one another amidst scattered bits of humanism. What kind of individual can survive in such a dog eat dog environment, and what does it do to them, the series has us ponder. Meanwhile, the elite sit back and enjoy the spectacle, having set up an ominous power structure of men behind masks to keep everyone in line, and to kill when necessary. It's clearly a metaphor for the human condition under extreme forms of capitalism.

There are lots of great characters here, starting with Lee Jung-jae, #456, the gambling addict who owes a lot of money and had his wife take their daughter and leave him for another man. O Yeong-su (#001, the elderly man), Park Hae-soo (#218, his childhood friend), and Heo Sung-tae (#101, the vicious gangster) all shine, and the series did a good job of letting us see their back stories. That's true of the female characters as well, who I really liked here, including Kim Joo-ryoung (#212, the wildly effusive con), HoYeon Jung (#067, the sullen North Korean defector), and Lee Yoo-mi (#240, who killed her abusive stepfather). The plot easily could have been too simple and linear, but through these characters and some of the subplots, like the illicit business set up by some of the guards to sell organs, it was able to keep itself larger than the sum of its (violent) parts.

I found that it also worked as a critique of voyeurism (including the viewer!), for while one may think of the barbarity of the Roman Colosseum while watching this as something distant from themself, one is inevitably drawn to the incredibly cruel games, wondering who will survive. I thought it might have been a teeny bit more effective had the VIP's not been present in the later episodes though, since their dialogue was so shlocky and it seems to me that a lot of ultra-powerful are often more hidden in the real world. I just imagined that a call at the end from the Front Man (the overseer) which alluded to him answering to others and a larger structure might have been more sinister and powerful. No matter though. This is an entertaining series on several levels, and kept those of us watching it guessing as to what would happen moment to moment. I hope the following seasons are able to keep up with fresh social commentary, and not devolve into the spectacle of the games."
"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.

It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again."
"Who needs to watch 455 people being murdered? Some odd messaging on capitalism and income disparity coupled with reality TV game shows. Hey ccool, look the losers don't just fall into a pool then fall into an incinerator. Give it pass."
"Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you'd do in a game if it was your life versus another's life. It's got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime."
Gratuitous violence. And we wonder why the world is in the state it is in. Trivializing atrocity by juxtaposing callous murder with cheerful music. Sick.
"The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire ""VIP"" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?"
"I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history."
"Honestly wow - from the first episode I sat wide mouthed, what am I watching and why - I didn't care.

This series is amazing, it's brutal, it made me cry - what a watch.

Suddenly you don't care about the subtitles, they pale into nothing, they don't matter - you find yourself watching this, reading effortlessly.

An amazing series, thank you!"
Overhyped show for CW teens. Don't trust other reviews.
"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2."
"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too."
The people's bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.
"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.

Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.

Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.

Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made."
"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera."
"I really don't know what all the fuss is about... The acting is strong (as expected from Korean actors and actresses) but most people are talking about the plot, which to me, is nothing special. Sure there are some plot twists but there are also way too many gaps for this to be called a ""classic"" or ""masterpiece""."
"For someone who has seen Alice in Borderland and loved it, I see this series as a more mature and rawer version, without fantasies. Criticism of the capitalism of today's society, ironic how it turned out, becoming everything it criticized.

Decent 8/10."
"I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. ""Gganbu"" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the ""one"" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.

They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.

The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.

Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall."
"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time."
"I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There's a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?"
"Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.

Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time."
"The show does not live up to the hype.

It's ok, but not as spectacular as the hype would indicate. I preferred alice in borderland over squid games. Now they are pushing for season 2, and I am guarantee you, season 2 gonna fail - big time! Mark my words."
"The symbolism behind this show is representative of The Dangerous Game and Eyes Wide Shut. Satanic billionaires that run all our world institutions bored with all they have desperate to feel any kind of emotion, which apparently comes from dehumanizing the masses and defiling the innocent.

Those that find enjoyment are already lost to degeneracy. You are subconsciously being conditioned to accept this as normal. Pay attention.

Is it a conspiracy theory if they are telling you what they are doing?"
"Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don't need me to give you this warning. ""Squid Game"" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it's NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You'll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don't say I didn't warn you!

In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" or the ""Hunger Games"" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in ""Squid Game"" know what they're in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.

The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun's life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He's deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He's ruined his, his wife's and his daughter's lives.

When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they'll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn't realize is that by doing this, he's agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.

Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn't sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he's with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they're in for with these strangely clad 'hosts'. They are told they're playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it's all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it's a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they'd BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they'll die...and die many of them do.

After this 'game', about 200 of them were killed. But here's where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it's my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.

Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the ""Fargo"" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from ""Hunger Games"" and ""Battle Royale"" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I'd only planned on seeing and episode or two.

By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars."
"The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.

It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.

And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:
The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.



The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.



The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?



Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?



The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.



I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).



Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the ""fairness"" of the games?



456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?



His hair looked awful red. That is all.



Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyone
He abandoned his daughter AGAIN.



He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.



When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?



The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?



One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.



How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?



The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.



Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.


Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!"
"I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.

In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).

This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it."
"A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained."
"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.

In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.

The game

The game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.

""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""

Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.

The island, the leader and the policeman

The game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.

The secondary players

Between the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...

The old man and the main character

Finally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore."
"Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can't say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn't make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.

7/10: good but not great."
"A great story and sufficient background to get the series started with the pilot episode. But by the 4th eps it's dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of ""fair play"".

Two games later they throw out this concept and it's all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.

This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.

I'm sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script. Could have been a 9 star series but just got boring and predictable."
This TV show was very sad in the beginning but as it goes on it get good the story is very well written and I got to warn you its very graphic I give this show a thumbs up make that 4.
"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!

Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb."
"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it."
"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.

Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.

As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.

And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.

It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.

Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.

Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.

In summary, too much agenda, too little plot."
"I feel like I can't really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It's a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it's always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It's like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That's pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.

A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone's chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn't kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.

There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn't even know if he could dive or not. It's also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.

The main problem is of course the big reveal. It's all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn't work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It's inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn't speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.

And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying ""Well, you said the rules were such and such so that's how I won the game"". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It's not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it's just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don't even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it's just a random twist. It's not some info we were looking for.

The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn't spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It's not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It's not smart stuff."
"This show is a farce. The acting is Atrocious!!!!!! How is this drivel getting such high reviews???? It's terrible, its awful."
"I just loved it! You can easy watch it during all weekend non stop! It's so much different from other series available. Completely different genre.

Recommended to everyone."
"Squid Game is a series full of details that make it stand out from many others. We can be sure that it was an expensive production for the quality that it presents in all departments. The cinematography is exquisite, with well-thought-out slow-motion shots building tension and accompanying the soundtrack in perfect harmony. The children's songs they use help add a creepy effect to the scene and later become such popular songs as Frank Sinatra's ""Fly me to the moon""."
This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.
"Pros: 1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.

2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.

3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.

4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.

5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.

6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.

7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.

8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.

9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).

Cons: 1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.

2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.

3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.

4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.

5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.

6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt."
"The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.

The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.

This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.

All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.

I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further."
"While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga ""Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji"", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing ""Squid Game"".

The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this ""inspiration"".

There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. ""Squid Game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" (2018) or the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""The Vengeancers""."
"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.

Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?

No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.

And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.

He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die."
One of the best shows I've watched! Everyone of the actors was so so good.
"Could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. Extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... I kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. I do not understand what the hype is all about."
"Wanted to give up after episode one Managed to force myself to watch episode 2

My oh my what utter drivel

What are these people give 9-10 scores smoking???

Nothing happens

The main character is utterly unlikeable

Worst series ever!!

So dull."
"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show."
"Starts off pretty well in the first episode. Then it's just downhill and pointless. The ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap It turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. Doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get."
"Very very minor spoiler. The show as a whole was phenomenal, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, but the ending was weak. The second half of the last episode honestly weakened my rating by two full stars. Still worth it though."
"I watched two episodes and I had enough. There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long."
"A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children's games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are 'eliminated' is expertly done (episode 6, ""Gganbu"" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the 'play grounds' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets 'Squid Game' apart from similar 'deadly games' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral 'realistic' and disturbing way. Not to everyone's' taste but entertaining and compelling."
"No wonder this series took so long to create and it shows because there's literally not one flaw. It's perfect in every sense and has every major ingredient that makes it one of the best shows of this decade hands down!

The acting; absolutely incredible. The leads acting is stunning and beautiful even without him saying anything his facial expressions speaks volumes in VERY dramatic scenes (which scenes aren't?)

The directing is stellar and flawless. I love shows that are truly unique; Severance, Night Sky just to make a couple.

My favorite series just to give my opinion of this series context; Mr. Robot, The leftovers, Fargo, Dark, Altered Carbon S1, Westworld s1, Legion, Severance, Night Sky, Utopia UK, Black Mirror too many to list but if you like a few of said shows you will love this 100%.

You get attached to most of the characters and note: watch this with subtitles for the full experience as intended.

This is probably the most addicting bingable show 11 out of 10 easy.

You'll thank me give it a shot."
"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh."
"Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off. The only problem with this is that as more and more people got killed, it provided more screen time for the rest of the unlikable characters. The premise and story are ok, but the execution ruins it."
"I don't understand the hype. Alice in borderland is much more better than this. Maybe it get it's hyped because of Netflix,I don't see any other reason."
Love this show. I've watched the series twice now but keep getting distracted by the officer's battery life on his phone. He was taking pictures and videos and making notes the whole time he was there and never ran out of battery...lol.
"Actually, i didn't watch any korean movies or series before. But i believe that no one denies that this show is one of the greatest shows ""this year at least""."
"One of the best and most interesting shows I've seen in recent years. I was hooked right from the start. Far out plot, wonderfully unique and layered characters, and a true breakneck pacing that's sure to keep you glued. I went in rather skeptical since hype has often let me down, but I can honestly say I was dead wrong. As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.

Incredible."
"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films."
"It wasn't until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn't bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.

The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line."
"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.

Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.

The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""

All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.

""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs."
"Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! ??????"
"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.

A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.

Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.

P. S. Would you play?"
"This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece."
"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.

For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.

Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.

Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.

This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun."
"The success of the movie, ""Parasite"" has given RPG film makers brain freeze. If South Korean filmmakers hate Capitalism so much, its a short trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, horrible over acting. Inconsistent internal logic. Full of plot holes. Non violent scenes are devoid of entertainment and violent scenes are repetitious and disgusting."
"One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ?"
I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.
I never write reviews but i feel compelled to for this masterpiece. I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as I can so you can experience it for yourself if you haven't already. Let me just start by saying the entire cast did an amazing job with their characters. They really deserve all the credit. The show is so unique and a breath of fresh air from all the overused stereotypical Hollywood stuff you see today. It really is a tear jerker and pulls at your heart strings in some moments. Is very thought provoking as well and leaves you guessing at every turn. I loved all the twist you see and especially the finale. Makes you question humanity and our morality. I'm sad it took me so long to get around to watching it but I'm really glad I did. I can't wait for season 2!!! Here's to hoping Netflix doesn't cancel it like they usually do.
"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.

There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.

The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.

EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet."
"Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.

8/10 for Season 1."
"The games ar nothing but a real life projection, ""a democracy"" based on rules made by capitalism, no one takes it seriously until you need money... you work with no limits and you never find happiness... try to look different into this movie and you will find the true message, true about rules in society, about democracy, and how people change themselves how money can change someone, overall great story, great idea."
"Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.

The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.

The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season)."
"I recently got into Netflix again I take breaks and use other services glad I finally decided to watch this whacky series! Probably get hate for this but I watch the English dub version cause I don't do well with subtitles still lovable show. The music, flow of everything, absurdity, and story is all excellent!"
"It's nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you'll easily forget it in few seconds after."
"Squid Game is no show that hit me that much - I watched a couple of episodes and was rather bored, I would prefer to watch some real MMA fights - more excitement and action going on, and less drama. The first episode dragged on and on and on till the first real action. The second episode was a rather redundant detour of the story. The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game. So what's left? Some nice ideas (the games), some solid action and a sip of blood, but with too much uninteresting filler time. Summa summarum: Not that bad but rather just another hype, just my few cents of course."
"Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.

Nothing really new in the plot. Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.

I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.

A great binge watch!"
"This is a simple formula that has been done to death ""poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch"". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like ""it's an study of human nature"" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke."
"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.

When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.

These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
"One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.

I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.

This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.

And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion."
"Even if you've seen ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Money Heist"", ""Squid Game"" (called ""Ojing-eo Geim"" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.

Definitely see it. You'll never look at any children's game the same way again after seeing it."
"Are we supposed to feel empathy for a man who becomes a billionaire and then chooses his own vindication over his daughter? Plot is boring and shallow, characters don't develop and the reason behind the games is 'rich people get bored'.

Full of tropes, misogyny and a sprinkling of racism. Not even that gory, not scary or tense, and the VIPs are like true blood's worst reserve actors."
The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.
"Squid games is amazing! From the first episode to the last, the tv series had my attention! Can't wait for season 2.

Explores human psychology really well!"
"This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.

It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!"
"Squid Games - Let the Games Begin! This was an extreme bazaar competition amongst willing participants in a progression of children's games where all they have to do is follow the rules to win a huge cash prize. However, they did not know what they were getting into when they signed up and did not know what the meaning of ""elimination"" meant. The episodes are extremely frightening and violent and not meant for anyone other than adults if even that. One criticism I have is the title of the series because it may entice teens to watch it - they might want to see what kind of game this is, and it is clearly not for the unattended child or teen. There was something off about the VIPs - I am not sure if they were supposed to be Americans but if so, they weren't portrayed right as the English isn't the way an American would speak or it is dubbed funny or just something off. I knew there was something more to some of the characters which will be divulged at the ending of the series. The last person standing gets a make-over and looks ridiculous with that bright red hair and if they get on that plane to LA they will be laughed at and called Bozo. I think a more attractive look could have been selected. Only 9 episodes makes this a short series, however Netflix just announced Season 2 so there will be more to come."
"The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2."
Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.
"Personally found it to be somewhat of a combination of Saw, Hunger Games and Parasite, though very original in its own way.

A great new TV show to binge (but maybe not with the family)"
"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".

It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.

The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.

As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer."
"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.

But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.

In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence."
"Really good show, until the VIPs show up in episode 7. Worst acting I've ever seen. It's like the director doesn't understand English himself and hired random American guys off the street. It doesn't ruin the show, but it's so bad. In general though this is definitely worth a watch."
"OK yes, the VIP acting was atrociously bad and at the end it got a bit predictable. But other than that this is a masterfully crafted drama by filmmakers who damn well know how to create tension and suspense. I was worried that the ""game"" would turn into a gimmick, but it works so so so well! The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the ""game"" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!

TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP's

Looking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!"
"This Korean Tv-show is so damn good. Sends you chills and excitement through the whole episodes. At the very end, they also hands over a cliffhanger, can't wait for the next season. What a shame on the bad reviews, people don't really get it. But I get it, Korean masterpiece at it's finest. Greetings from Sweden! ????"
The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.
I m falling shortage of words. All i can say is it is 100/100 and a must watch for all thriller show lovers. All episodes are worth watching.
"It's hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it's expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it's just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.

At the same time it's hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they're not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.

Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above."
"It's really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible.

I will say though, the main character and his acting wasn't too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it's a waste of time.

Anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series."
"Low effort program basically designed to entertain simple people who like to watch people die. Not even remotely good, the bar continues to sink."
"This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the ""raging hype"", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.

The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.

Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema."
"Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:

1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.

2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?

3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?

4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.

5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.

6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.

7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again."
"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.

Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.

The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.

Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.

Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.

The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.

The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.

Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)"
"The fact that Squid Game is the #1 series in the World right now helps explain a lot when it comes to the fact that everyone seems to be mentally disturbed these days.

Interesting and fast-paced series, yes. But VERY disturbing."
"Sorry folks, this is not good. I don't know why there is so many great reviews. The main guy is an idiot and loser and not likable at all. But that is not the bad part. Why would you participate in something you have no idea what it is? They will offer you lots of money if you win? You don't think it could be dangerous? No one asked this? All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing. They never mentioned that you can't quit in the first episode. I would say f this I'm out after the first game."
"I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended."
"Caught a bit by the hype I decided to check this out and boy was I in for a convoluted messy nonsense pile of garbage.

I will not go through all the problems with each episode but rather describe the three overarching issues I have with the show.

1) the acting - the acting is fine from the 3-4-5 main characters, everyone else however are horrible at it. Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.

2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.

3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.

Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them. A generous 3/10 and I can not recommend anything about this."
"Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.

Easily predictable on what happens and who's who.

The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i'd throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross.

It's not unique it's not different. It's all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise

If I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done."
"The hype for this series is real. With incredible acting, and interesting dynamics and twists, I was on the edge of my seat almost all the time. The juxtaposition of children's games with horrifying themes was a great choice, and the overall design was top notch, especially the set design and costume design. Not only was it good looking it was memorable.

Lee Jung-jae's performance was top notch, as was the majority of the performance from all main and supporting characters. The only exception here is the VIP's who were unbearably bad. I'm not sure if it was the dialogue or something, but they were just bad in general. There was also one particular plot point that was a little too obvious from the beginning, but no spoilers.

It was all around one of the best shows I've seen. Great writing, acting, design, characters, cinematography, twisty plots, and more.

Production/Cinematography: 5/5 Acting/Characters: 4/5 Plot: 4.5/5 Writing: 5/5 Soundtrack: 4.5/5."
"The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn't really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.

However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.

On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!"
"This show is absolutely terrible, and the acting is shockingly crap, it's like rewatching the old Monkey series.

Pretty crap for this day and age.

Crap characters and crap show."
"This is a great show to binge watch, even if it doesn't introduce anything all that new and original.

The fact that it isn't American made means that it's one show that Netflix couldn't poison with its toxic political agendas. It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays.

I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn't end with any conclusion.

But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.

In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.

But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now."
"As we enter I don't know the 10th lockdown in my country thanks to the coronavirus and its variants dropping sequels and prequels every so often I finally decided to check it out and see what the hype is about.

Literally finished the show start to finish ! Edge of the seat type of show.

The plot itself is simple but the direction the screenplay and the casting ..mind blowing !"
"My ears rang, the never-ending drone of people clamoring on about a new television show, one that raised their expectations of Korean cinema and the content Netflix sponsors. I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn't grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.

As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55"" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.

Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn't remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn't feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don't know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn't take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.

So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television."
"This is everything wrong with modern film-making. The whole thing lacks any logical sense, it drags on for way too long, the games are moronic and unimaginative, the characters are shallow, there is not even an attempt at creating some nuance and emotion, I would have more compassion watching chicken die than this absolutely ridiculous man-slaughter. The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste. If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though. It's literally that, nothing more."
"Simply immersive. Thats my general consensus. I am only up to episode 4?(i am binging it so lost track) but this is almost meditative - the scope of this. The filmaking is on another level. Its so revolutionary, everything in it. Dont want to spoil it. Must watch..

the acting is just superb and it will keep you guessing.

The genre not to spoil is mystery/dystopia."
"I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.

Were there bad plot holes?

Yes.

Did the VIPs episode suck?

Yes.

But did that hinder the overall series?

No.

Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.

Pros:
Good acting
The childish games with a twist were fun
Light plot, easy to follow.



Uncomplicated characters
Stellar cast


Cons:
VIPs episode
Policeman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?



Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)


Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out."
"It started good but end up pretentious.

There were many things left unexplained like 1- the videos were already sent to police .

2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .

3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .

4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .

5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.

6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense either

I don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .

My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .

And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.

I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character ."
"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.

Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!"
"Conceptually interesting and visually engaging. Horrible plot where there is no background for most things. Subpar acting. The scenes of the actual games are fun, but other than that, nothing in this lazily executed series makes sense."
"I came in with big expectations...and, yup it was worth the hype.. First half was amazing...the build-up was great.. It was an intense, emotional, heartbreaking ride.. I cried which is usually hard for me to do especially over a movie / series.... Everything was great until they reached their limit of creativity and trying...long story short... everything stopped being serious and authentic like before and from now on it was a drag until the end... Second half was so mediocre and underwhelming and sadly even poorly executed.. Didn't even have a realistic feel to it like the beginnings...I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time..."
I stayed up till 4 AM watching this one. After seeing Squid Games i will be heading into a Korean Film binge watch. What a story where the elite rule the world. Hmmm could this be another case where the bank rollershave to shows us their intent before doing so?
"Yea sorry alert from those ( who I think may have struggled due to language and culture barriers so nobody's fault really ) the series was one of the best things I've been seen . I'm pooped I watch it in two days and I need a holiday . I like to think I cry at things when it's needed but I'm either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I've ever witnessed from a show . I was a mess .... literal snot everywhere and sobbing noises which concluded at the end of the dining episode .. anyways I'm off to chill coz I'm shredded and need to be ok for a wedding this week. Bravo actors , writers , directors and everyone else it was a triumphal . Bravo."
"If you haven't seen Korean movies or shows before hand, you will blown away from this show. Squid Games is well crafted to be enjoyable to what show about human demons and family. The end was predictable (as I have seen other Korean films and shows), something won't be right, there is no happy end at no cost. This was good show compared to any poor attempt to create anything original (*cough cough American shows ). I hope this cultural exchange will help the viewers to see other types of screen play and to learn to distinguish the good from the absolute trash."
"I wasn't hoping it to be this good but it has a good story, good graphics and well acted. Teaches a few life lessons. Sometimes the story gets slow but picks up later on. A great watch indeed."
"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.

There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.

Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.

In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.

Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.

I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.

I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.

But he should have gotten on the plane."
"This isnt one of them. There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained. They dregs weren't much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe. The end was fitting. Bleak. The movie was bleak. Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn't one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste."
Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.
"I am aware other countries have a fierce audience for ""game shows"" well this might wet their whistles, but it was hard for me to watch! I'm not a horror genre and this because of the amount of violence sits on that line and sometimes I leaned left while sometimes I leaned right. It was new creative good characters - just couldn't commit to 9 stars!"
"First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.

This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.

Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.

Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It."
"Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.

It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today's world."
"Therefore I vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it."
"The only good part of it is the music played before the game being, which is stolen from Hunger Games. Including the megaphone effect."
"Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!

It's near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are: 1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it's lost in translation) 2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world's richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script..."
"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.

456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.

Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.

In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.

Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.

Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time."
"""Squid Game Dethroned In Netflix's Top 10 List By A New Show"" It should have never reached the top 10 list in the first place! The show sucks! Two episodes of this silliness and I was done!"
"This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2."
"It seems to me that too many Humans with not much of the grey matter are such Gullible People getting excited about this absolute Rubbish.

Try getting outside a bit more People????"
"The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.

Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?

And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?

After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.

This is a mess; don't waste your time."
"I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror."
"Life is no longer any fun when you are too broke, but so it isn't either when you are too rich. Those two extreme worlds meet.

Money is not what makes life worth living, after all - could you do whatever it would take to achieve a big amount of money so you never would have to think amount making more money in your life?

The old man says, fun is what makes life worth living, when you are a kid you can spend hours and hours and completely forgetting the time, by playing fun games with your friends. When you are too rich those small things you had before that gave life pleasures, such as food, etc. Just wont reach anymore it won't be enough. -Do you lose motivation too much, when you have a table full of almost endless possibilities that you now no longer have to work for in order to slowly achieve?

But instead to just live in the present, have enough in the little things in life, and with good company?

They are just free to be, just exist, no stress, or... so that was a reality as a kid that is, according to this tv series.

Another man says: I am not a horse, we are not horses. For you to bet money on. Our lives are not for your entertainment. (so he did himself in the past as a way of an ""income"", ironic huh.) When rich men get too powerful and too bored with life, when life is too easy; even so when one of them at least risked his own life more or less by participating in the game himself as well."
"Must Must must watch it, I finished it in just one day, i was glued with my chair whole day to finish last episode get predictable But it don't ruin your enjoyment. I heard about it from one of my friend and watched it and won't regret."
"In my opinion, ""Squid Game"" is overhyped, and I don't see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.

The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like ""Cube"". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.

Do I think it's a bad show? No, it's decent and I don't regret watching it. Yet it's quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content.."
"Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure."
"I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?

I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?"
"I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.

*** SPOILER ALERT *** I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.

As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!

My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,"
"Whilst initially i took the bait like the rest of humanity but it didn't take long to discover the simplistic predictable storyline & let me say ""unique"" acting performances. But let's face, i don't thing anything in human history is capable of living up to that nonsensical level of hype. Massive credit goes to the creation of the concept but i genuinely believe this should have been a movie not a series."
"Saw films, Gantz anime, Alice In Borderland tv series, High Rise Invasion manga, and more have done this formula. Some of which have done this formula better.

The only thing that Squid Game adds new, is that it is South Korea's own take on it, with a kdrama spin.

At max, this is a 6 star at best, and a 2 star at its' worst. I'm just not as entertained, compared to other kdramas and survival game narratives (as listed above)."
"People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they're right; however, to oversimplify the show as another ""Dystopian Future Game Show"" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).

Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow. I look forward to where this story goes."
It is nothing but an overhyped series . Games are made for fun . Here some psycho people somehow target bankrupt people to play game . Those who failed are killed by armed guard . Sometimes players took the life of each other . One winner among 456 people . Two twist as expected . It's a total waste for me . Nothing to learn from this idiotic series .
Didn't like the Korean overacting or the premise or the pacing. Got 2/3rds of the way through Ep1 and gave up. Can't see what all the fuss is about and I normally give stuff like this a chance.
"Man! This show!

Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!

Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this."
"I fail to see what got people so hyped about this. It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written ""twists"" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment."
"...Korean, Chinese and Japanese.

Dear Hollywood...R. I. P."
"This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling."
"How is this currently on a score of 8.2? The lead character was SO annoying in the first 30 minutes that I switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through.

It's not a patch on either Battle Royale or the American version of that, Hunger Games.

It drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat.

Watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff."
"If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.

The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.

It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.

Overall, 6/10.

Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy."
"If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!

Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!

The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !

MUST WATCH."
"First and foremost, a big round of applause for the director ?????? This is by far the darkest and most 'un-korean', edgiest Korean TV series I've watched to date.

There isn't the typical sponsored usage of Samsungs, Mercedes, Subway, McDonald's or any of the big names that one would catch in a typical Korean TV series.

It's grippingly leaves you at the edge of your seat craving for the next episode and the next.

A must watch and absolutely loved the idea of the series."
"This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn't understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too."
"I have to agree that the VIPs are the weakest point to the show, but they hardly ruin it. Don't let the criticism towards them stop you from watching what may be the best miniseries I've ever seen.

I look forward to watching this again."
"This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.

A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.

Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.

If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.

Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series..."
Wow! Amazing show worth watching for sure. Concept was so good. The VIPs doe.. their acting was weird. Other than that the whole show keeps you on the edge.. the characters were really well played and I can't wait for the next season.
"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.

Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.


Great Character development - Check
Perfect Casting - Check
Perfect screenplay and progression - Check


A brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.

And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.

I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions."
"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.

It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great."
"Greetings from Lithuania.

I liked and enjoyed ""Squid Game"" (2021) series for its interesting and simple concept which at the end of the day was very solidly executed. Acting was very solid, as well as directing and writing. The whole concept felt fresh and kinda original and it was easy to get attached and watch the whole show. Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.

Overall, i enjoyed ""Squid Game"". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I'm in for this show."
"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices."
"Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.

Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing. I love an open end that leaves you imagining your own conclusions. Well acted, good character development, heart breaking and whilst not entirely original it had enough going for it to make it stand out."
"There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it."
"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.

No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap."
"I initially gave this a 9/10... then it was mid way through my 2nd rewatch of the show when it clicked... I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I've ever watched a live action foreign show. That's what clicked and made me give it 10/10.

In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language. The show has it's flaws, but by far one of the best shows I've ever seen."
"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.

Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2."
"If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.

Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.

It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.

It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended."
"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents."
Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.
"A hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys' Zeitgeist. The series is far away from the mentioned ""masterpiece"". Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special."
"Though not as intricate as Alice in Borderland or any similar web series, Squid Game manages to engage the audience till the end. Most characters have depth, and all the actors have done justice to their roles. Sound mixing and costume design are excellent. The actor who played an old man Oh Il Nam was one of the finest among the cast. His dialogue delivery and comic timing were so natural and he was likable(?;-)

Rating:

Story: 2.5/5 - Starts slow at first but not bad after the game starts.

Screenplay: 3.5/5 - Some unecessary (adult) scenes but pace is perfect

Characters & Acting: 4/5 - Few annoying characters, but rest are good. I didn't find anyone's acting below average.

Production Values: 5/5 - The costume design of guards and the front man, the VIP Masks, the wall decors, VFX, Sound Mixing, Lighting, etc were brilliant for a web series

Total: 15/20 - 8/10."
"So overrated.

Watched in fast forward since it's full of soup for the soul long scenes.

Seen much better ones with similar theme.."
Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we've seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good . And it does do as a good enough past time. Its just not something that needed to be a series.
"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..

in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?

And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get something

but it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staff

and at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?

And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..

And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhere

and if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..

The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending."
"A series with completely unique n innovative script ever! Portrays all human emotions of helplessness, greed, competition, violence, deceit, struggle, guilt. A true master creation at its best!"
One of the best kdramas ever. I will défini rewatch t many times.
"I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.

Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.

This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health."
I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of the serie the movie was really boring and predictable! Especially the last episode was really terrible and I hoped that I shouldn't follow this seire!
"This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.

Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.

Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!"
"Ahhh, it's been months since I've seen the whole series BUT...so far...

We need more of these crazy and hilarious KOREAN FILMS

I love the ideas, drama, and overall clumsiness and chaos of it all. The execution and preciseness can always use some work but this film succeeded and surpassed it's goals; and that is, to entertain and make a huge profit!

Every person in America has likely heard about this dramatic television series especially now in the information age."
"If not the best new show on TV--and it may be exactly that--certainly one of the most outrageous. Set in South Korea, it stars Lee Jung-jae as a hardcore gambler in debt to the mob with child support payments he can't maintain and medical bills for his ailing mom that he can no longer afford to pay. When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there's a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that's all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, ""Squid Game"" is quite a ride. The ending is a jaw-dropper, too. It's already been renewed for a second season, and I can't wait."
"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it."
"Its definitely a 10/10 series, amazing performance by all actors!! Waiting for season 2 eagerly."
"I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.

There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.

I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting."
"My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.

The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.

In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i'd feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.

I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.

At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.

The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate 'hunger games'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It's just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!

The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head ""what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?"". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.

Ending, without any spoilers... Here's the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn't end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it's a 9-episode long show, the ""sad ending"" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.

Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.

I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it's either all or none case, sadly. I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one."

Series Review - Squid Game (Season 1).

I confess that I went to watch this series thinking it would not be good. As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a ""popocão"" to marathon. I was wrong.

The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you're tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.

Overall, it's guaranteed fun. The show's aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don't. Skip the details and have fun.

Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won't give it a higher rating, but it's a very good series.

Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.

Rating: 4/5 - Very good series."
I love the twisted concept of childhood games mixed with death. I love this! The pressure put on the characters to win the game or die is pretty intense.
"Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!

Ok, rant over lol.

I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other ""stuff"" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.

The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...

I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.

Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.

Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards."
"Only a sociopath will like watching something like this. The show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. If you don't realise that I'm sorry for you. I love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. This is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during COVID and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. This is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!"
Squid is a great show I will not write a long review but you need to watch it.
"The last thing people in a world afflicted by so many conflicts is a show that boast nothing but violence to the extreme. I stopped watching after the 1st episode.

No content whatsoever. Just disgraceful violence. My suggestion: Watch The Crown, The Queen's Gambit, Unorthodox, Ozark. Even Breaking Bad. Something they will make you think. Squid Game is bad content to the soul, to the mind. And what amazes me is that the whole world has become addicted to this brutal unnecessary bloodshed. World's gone crazy."
"I really don't get the hype. Done 5 episodes now and find it all rather boring.

Maybe I was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to Battle Royale....?"
"It was such an amazing show! I binge watched it and I hope they have a season 2. You sympathize with all the characters and you stay on the edge of your seat on every episode, and the performance of the actors that was amazing!"
"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant."
"This is a masterful blend of elements of fantasy, psychological thriller, character development, personal journal- a refreshing example of superbly crafted storyline's. At last!! A decent , fresh program on Netflix!

This Korean series is addictive, superbly cast, cleverly directed & beautifully production designed. The editing is gripping.

The sound effects are nail biting. We loved it.

5 stars to all the lead actors.

Cannot wait for the series 2.

But please, please, please- don't extend forever into series 6,7, 8...etc, etc, like some of the other substandard Hollywood shows that Netflix has commissioned before."
"There are a lot of holes in the plot...Many, maybe too many.

But I had a nice time, which is the objective of entertainment.

My grade: Acting (Korean style): 3/3 Scenario (some flaws): 2/3 Production (inconsistencies): 2/3 No cancel culture, gay couples, or save the planet BS: 1/1."
"So good I can't even describe it , story acting everything is soooooo goooood !"
"If you can deal with the graphic violence you'll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended."
A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.
Absolutely amazing show. A must watch for people that can handle it. Episodes are always interesting.
"Must watch. In my personal opinion this is one of the best series I have watched. It takes you breathless from start to the end. Every episode is a trill and enjoyment. I wish american series are like this, but unfortunately most of them these days try to milk it to the end and spoil everything they make. I am so glad that someone actually rise above Hollywood. It was about time !!!"
"And all of this about some paper??? (and I'm not talking about the deforestation...or am I?)

I mean..there's nothing human left in humanity, isn't it? We all know the answer but it's still deeply disturbing and saddening.

Well, they tried to give us hope and even though there's no reason to, I'm not ready to give up on that...yet.

The fact that I cried for that old guy; what more can I say?!

FUN?! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???

I remembered smth from ""Crash"" which fits perfectly here

""It's the sense of touch. (...) We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.""

And there's that about social classes, hierarchy, capitalism, religion, nature vs. Nurture, immigration, suicide, love, blah-blah

The show is brilliant!"
"If you're on the fence, definitely give the show a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my ""all-time favorites"" now.

It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.

Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try."
"I don't watch many foreign shows or movies, but with all the popularity surrounding this show I just had to watch it. ""Squid Game"" is a very engaging show that keeps you hooked in with its various twists and surprises that keep you watching. While the last episode failed to satisfy some aspects of the series, it still wrapped things up nicely and did a great job of showing the consequences of a society were the rich are the only ones who benefit. Very excited for season two."
"Good idea and first episode but by episode 4 i'd had enough. Too weird, violent and unlikeable characters."
I can't wait to forget about this show so I can watch it all over again. Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.
"We all know this Show broke records and became really famous, and for good reason. It has a really good concept and Good actors. The Korean actors atleast, the VIPs literally made me want to punch something, so cheesy it was painful to watch. But other than that the rest of the show was awesome and fun to watch.

Also I hate episode 6."
"Thought it'd be more intellectual but just a lot if violence, gore, bad acting, and more violence. Called the main plot line in the first show. If the games were more thoughtful, this could have been good. And suicide so many times? Organ harvesting? Geez, check more boxes.

Skip it."
"The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it's really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes. The first episode is arguably the most intense and shocking 55 minutes ever filmed. So there's bound to be a drop off. Even so, the entire series is extremely watchable and even binge worthy. If you're looking for something different... THIS IS IT !!"
"I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.

Just watch and you won't regret it. I'm becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.

Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once."
"Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of ""Animal World!"" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong. It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I'm hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!"
"One of the most beautiful series I've ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed."
This series is just great as it is. It teaches a lot about people and makes us wonder what would we do? Nothing could make me cry since Titanic until now. The scene when Ali dies is the saddest of all.
"Basically a Gore horror show like ""The Hostel"" but bubble tea store like colours and Costumes worn which gave the audience a thrilling experience of this ""weird feeling"" because our brains usually don't connect Horror with Happy colours. So yes this show is meant for those who love death and has desires to watch others being killed - for the psychopathic audience."
"Awesome combination of Drama, suspense, thrill & A small demo of today's World.

Must watch, its fictional but I'll give you some true life lessons, who is your friend, who is your enemy."
"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series."
"The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.

Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.

What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.

I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc."
"TV made for violent lowbrows. Parasite was rubbish, this is even worse."
When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.
"It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama.

Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well. Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist. It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show's problems) just cannot bear out."
"First off, if you are starting this show, please give it the respect it deserves and watch the original Korean version with the English subtitles. A lot of people can be incredibly lazy when it comes to foreign films/TV shows. Avoid the American dubbed version like the plague. Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It's over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don't rate a show because it's popular and trend. Yes, it can be annoying when a show suddenly becomes huge and everyone jumps on the bandwagon, but don't let that put you off. It's one of the best series Netflix has produced in years. Highly recommended."
Often tough to watch but a gripping series if you can see it out.
"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore."
"I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.

It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe."
"This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments. The series also reminds me of the movies called Hostel ( ""the horror ones"") but those films are like a concept if you watch Squid Game, it is like they copied your homework and made it 1000 times better."
The characters are extremely unlikable the acting is absolutely a joke it's almost like a five year old wrote out the script and the dialogue. There is nothing likable about this show it's absolutely a joke I think people are giving it high ratings just to be annoying.
"1-6 built strong momentum.

Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building. The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.

Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.

Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long."
"Amazing cinematography, great idea, but I think it should've been a movie or a 5-episode mini-series. Definitely overhyped and overrated, at this moment it scores 8.2, same level as Money Heist which is clearly a much better show.

It could be that English dubbing makes it less entertaining, but I also think that after the first 3-4 games writers have ran out of ideas."
"I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.

All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.

I would still recommend watching it."
"Everything boils down to bad guys in South Korea. They're not Korean, or even Asian. They're European Caucasians. Get that. The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I'm sure it's just a coincidence."
"I saw Squid game. It felt good. But not as good as the whole world was saying. The two reasons for this popularity are the unique storyline and Korean involvement. Major flaws exist. Unnecessary showed bad quality sex scene. There was a forceful storyline. Could have shown more murders. English dubbing was very bad. But the Hindi dubbing was very good. Hindi dubbing was far better than perfect. The dual element of entertainment was suspense & production design.

Marvel's Loki is much better than this. But if you see it, you will not understand anything. Because to watch it, you have to watch the entire Infinity Saga (total 23 movies) first."
"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad."
"The Netflix subscription is $9 but the therapy you'll need after this show is priceless.

To sum it up as briefly as possible, it's like a sundae made of scoops of Shawshank Redemption, The Purge, and the first Saw movie, with a little bit of Star Wars sprinkled on top."
"1. The Plot: We have seen it so many times. In ""Saw"", ""Hunger Games"", ""EscapeRoom"", ""13"" & etc.

2. The Games: They are not thrilling or exciting, just a bunch of childish games. Even sometimes they get really boring, like the marble mission.

3. Ending: Pure trash and total cliché. ""WE ARE RICH AND WE ENTERTAIN OURSELVES BY PLAYING CRUEL GAMES WITH PEOPLE"" !!! C'mon dudes! That same old crap again??? How many times we have to see this???

Total disappointment."
"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.

I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved."
"This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.

The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.

Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.

The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.

Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers."
"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.

We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.

Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.

Would you want a Season 2? I know I would."
"And because that rhymed I'll keep it going that way and to reiterate, I gotta say The episodes in the middle of the show are probably the strongest I ever saw of any tv series - forgein or domestic.

But in general - this show was majestic.

Character development is really great I cared for them quickly instead of late.

And to make them easier to differentiate, they even gave them numbers like 2-1-8.

The last 2 episodes fell off a little bit, but they're still good - not saying they're ... I think this production is the best to ever come out of Asia where the acting's usually dumb and over the top.

Here some of Asia's finest acting is displayed I really like how their characters are portrayed.

I'm late to the party, after the hype has died but let me close saying the hype was justified."
"Boring, predictable, a bad copy of hunger games, also a stinker, and Saw...kinda liked the first one... I think.

The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that's impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.

It's easily in the top 5 of the worst series I've ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at that I prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining."
"The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.

This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch."
"Last century misogyny, foul language, ageism, casual racism, greed and despair - basically everything that's wrong with South Korea today, and which would be outright rejected if this was a Hollywood/Western production. It's amazing how a few bits of cheap brightly coloured scenery and silly costumes can get people excited about what is a very old and trite concept. Yawn."
Don't waste your time on this pathetic series. You would be better off watching paint dry. Again Netflix produces more garbage entertainment. Gratuitous violence. Stupid plot. Unbearable acting.
Please remove all traces of the VIPs and you can get the 2 stars back.
"The writing, acting and almost everything else about it was so captivating and entertaining. I love the characters and the way that they make you feel so attached. Episode 6 is truly heartbreaking in terms of this aspect.

The music was another thing I enjoyed. I can't quite put my finger on why the music was so perfect. It just... was.

Although the acting of the white actors wasn't anywhere near as good the acting in the rest of the series, the rest of the show made up for it

Overall a great show and I would recommend."
"Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn't even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains... Ep 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely.. Ep 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios... I finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this..."
It's an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.
Simply Genius... A masterpiece... Its a must watch webseries.... Grt performance by each and every character... Waiting for season 02.. korean webseries are never disappoints..
"Hands down maybe the best show I have ever seen, can't stop thinking about it!"
"This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?

The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.

Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.

5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.

The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???

After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)

Plot twist was so predictable as well.

Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying."
"First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here."
"If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this. It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something. It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.

This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it."
"""You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on""

Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.

If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).

I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.

All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.

From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.

In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?"
"It's definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn't have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don't like korean drama can enjoy it.

If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.

This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time."
"This is a horrible show. The idea could have merit but the extremes on everything from the over acting, language, bad translation, script, over the top on blood and gore made trying to watch painful. I have also heard a lot of kids are watching this - it is definitely not a family friendly show."
"What a unique, entertainingly disturbing concept. The writing was well done and kept the watchers guessing with lots of twist and turns. You feel for individual characters struggling to survive that many people can relent too. The games are simple yet disturbingly twisted which keeps You wanting to see what comes next. Two thumbs up!!"
"But there were some plot holes. The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out.

Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade...

But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah."
"Episode 1 starts off a bit too slow but towards the end things get interesting. Episode 2 to 7 is amazing and provides something a bit different from what we've seen in the past year or so.

Episode 8 and 9 are terrible, they don't make any sense! I really don't want to include too many spoilers in this review.

Overall, we'll done to the main characters. The acting was amazing!!!!"
Some sick mind created this.. Unnecessary brutal piece of sh.t.
Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.
"I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!"
"Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.

The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.

Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions ""betrayed"" by only the twitching of one eye.

Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.

And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here."
"This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Prepare yourself, however, to be anxious and have your heart ripped out thanks to episode 6."
2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.
"This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D."
Very good tv show as i expected from the Korean shows but i think the storytelling is not very well although the characters are well written And i liked the Design and Music also some twist events.
"I got caught in the gushing for this series so couldn't wait to watch it.

Bitterly disappointed to be honest, so many plot holes that really distract from a good if not great premise.

The ending is incredibly poor I won't say more as I don't want to spoil it for you but honestly don't get your hopes up."
"I must say I started watching this because everyone is/was talking about it. So I went in expecting not very much, but I was wrong.

This show blew me away by the amazing story and the incredible performance of the actors (minus the VIP's).

It really strung me along till the very end and it didn't bore me a second.

Amazing show, very different from anything I had seen before.

Overall 9/10."
"Is this show art or sadistic hype? Or just criticism of capitalism? The cynical display of social injustice in Squid Game is not a pose. The South Korean screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the series during the 2008 financial crisis - brutally and directly.

The series is a criticism of the world as it is. A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.

A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King."
"Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.

Love it.

Watch it!"
"Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and ""deep"" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!

To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.


Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.



Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)



There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).



Many scenes are plain cliché/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the ""bad guy"" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a ""good guy""? Ridiculous.



The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.


I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells."
"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.

The only major problem I have with it is the acting.

It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.

Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.

So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting."
"This was a fantastic show. And like other great stories before it. It borrowed from great movies and shows that came before.

But the main issue with this series is that it's the first time watching SK content for most people.

I've been watching content from SK for years and got used to the style of overacting. Or seeing American/English speaking characters played by abismal actors.

People aren't used to this type of cinema. It's to strange and foreign so for most people they can't get over the experience. But they are making some of the best video content in the world.

Great show. Not perfect. But make a dramatic impact and was definitely memorable."
"When I first watched squid game, my standards weren't that high. However, it exceeded my standards and is up there with my top 3 favourite TV shows.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the interesting concept. The games were well designed and intense to watch and SOME characters you can relate with.

I think Squid Game is probably near to as good as the Saw franchise.

If you like Saw and survival movies, you should definitely watch, you won't regret it."
"Really great show. Story driven and well acted. The VIPs are the reason for loss of a star, horrible acting by them. Otherwise, give in to the hype, I watched the whole thing in a weekend."
"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series."
"So intense, so well crafted, so many meanings, dramatic, sadistic, emotional...television doesn't get much better than this."
It was so intresting that i finished all in 1 day.
"I loved this show!! I wish I could forget it and just watch it for the first time again! It stays in your mind for a while, the concept was insane and cruel.. The manipulation was the real game! They knew exactly how the instincts of the players will work each time.

I felt sorry for like everyone in the finale, but I liked the way he fixed the ""family issues"" with the little boy and the old lady!"
"A number of excellent films have come out of South Korea over the past decade or so. Now this, a blinder of a TV series. Absolutely fantastic. Was thinking of cancelling Netflix but glad I didn't."
"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.

This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.

This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.

I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.

Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.

This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.

It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.

Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.

Fairness is thrown out the window.

Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)

Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.

One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?

In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices."
"I do love Korean music, movies and series. So I'm overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I've seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.

I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.

What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.

The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.

The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.

Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.

10/10."
"This show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. I often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. This show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value."
"The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!"
This TV series was a great binge on a world that could possibly exist. Underground better people bet on more than chicken fights. Its hard at times with the english translation and the lips not matching the words but overall a great fresh take on a underground better world that may or may not exist.
If you are looking for a show with amazing performers (except the vip) then you need to watch squid game. Episode 6 is heart breaking. A tv show has yet to make me cry yet this one did. If I could give another standing ovation then I would.
"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better."
"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.

No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).

No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.

This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.

If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended."
"This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience and this is why it feels kinda off to those people We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations This is my theory I said what I said Love this series and it's the best thing that's come off Netflix in a while so think for a minute and stop hating on this detail in an otherwise AWESOME show!"
I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!
"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend."
"Takes the battle royale Hunger games style approach coupled with high stakes children's style games and creates an intriguing story of debt and greed. Shows how people can change when they are pushed so far. You will end up loving and hating characters, and be surprised at the plot twists. This is one of my new favorite shows. I hope Season 2 is as good or better than the first."
"It is disturbing in a way that why the hell is happening this ?

But I have to say that the plot is unique ( Not in a good way or bad way but very dark grey i guess ).

Okay, At last my opinion is one should watch this."
"So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don't worry about the bad VIPs, they're not in it for long and the masks are beautiful."
"Despite all the cringey memes and Instagram/TikTok trends that made the momentum of this show tired, the show itself is absolutely brilliant. I watched this show twice in full already, both the Korean version and the English Dub version. Both were actually really well done. I normally don't like English dubs, but they actually did a very good job with the dub for this one (minus the red light green light song and a couple of the translations). All the characters are really enjoyable and played their parts so well. When you see them in talk in interviews, you can see they difference and how well they played their parts. They're all so likeable and I hope some of them can return for season 2 somehow. Even the 'villains' are a hilarious and the sweetest people in real life, so you know how well they acted. The makeup and costumes and sets were brilliant. When you watch the behind the scenes footage on how they filmed it and the emotion they actors put into it, it's just so fascinating.

The story is both light-hearted and funny, but also very dark, deep and emotional. During and after each game, you feel the intense fear and grief that the characters are feeling and as the story progresses you feel that same uncomfortable feeling they do. The story has very deep undertones to the downfalls of how our society is and how the system takes advantage of our weaknesses and sets us up to fail.

On top of the story, the story on how the show was created was really beautiful as well. How the creator wrote those show many years ago and no one would take it or fund it, how he lost teeth from all the stress, how he had no money. It's almost like he was one of the players in the game itself.

I'm really looking forward to Season 2. I'm a bit worried though, because the creator didn't plan for a season 2 as he wasn't expecting it to be a global phenomenon, and he said he won't be writing season 2 on his own, it would be a team of people. So we'll see if they can keep the same deep quality and not ruin it."
Nice and innovative concept of this korean web series. From start to end it is nice to watch. Also very emotional at the end. Very few series has such a new concept.
"I've Watched All the Episodes of this Series and no doubt this one is one of my best korean series!!

This is Amazing Web Series with the mixture of Various References suh as Gambling, Humanity Survival, Honesty, Friendship, Money, and So many Deaths.

The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points I just Love this Korean Series and All the Charater were amazing. I'm waiting for 2nd Season that would be Intresting too I guess, haha.

Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!

Regards, Abhishek Kr."
"It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.

The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.

This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix."
"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters."
Damn what I just watched. And.episode 6 just squeezed all the tears out from me.
"Laughable acting and hilarious dialogue(in an unintentionally bad way), add English dubbing to this and you get Squid Game.

The over use of violence just makes it even more dumber, there is absolutely nothing realistic in this movie, even Purge made more sense.

Not sure how this gets such high ratings, Ed Wood has made better movies."
Devastatingly perfect. This level of gorgeousness should not be possible. Shakespearean in stature. Prepare all your human emotions for a descent into the core of the human condition.
"Just amazing, Korea movies has a kind of emotion express very strong of characters, not like US movies, usually less talking and less face's emotional, just like Parasite movie, also a good Korea movie, I really hope Korean can make more movies like this, very intense, drama and twist, which everybody loves it."
"This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money."
"To be honest, the first time I found out about ""Squid Game"" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.

After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children's games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.

The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?

The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).

In short, ""The Squid Game"" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10."
"Except for the VIPs acting and their embarrassing ""jokes"" - coughs *69,96* - Squid Game is one of the best shows ever being perfectly engaging and exciting."
"Warning do not watch the trailers do not read the reviews Just watch don't spoil it for yourself It is a must watch series In the beginning it was slow but as everything kicked off and started omg I was on the Edge of my seat non stop binge watched it all I had work the next morning at 2am I couldn't stop watching I had no sleep.

So must effort put into making it!"
Nothing about this series was special. Its stupid that this show got so popular. There are a million shows who followed this formula that is so much better. A lot say its a new concept well its not.
"It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that's been done countless times and sorry, this didn't sell it."
"Everything is predictable and nothing surprising happened about who survived the game and what happened at the end...the games had nothing like intelligent mind game, they are just a bunch of gambles plus trial of muscle strength which is completely a disadvantage for women. The masterminds, the fellows, rich vips, people who showed up in business scene etc are all male, also there were full of misogyny and insulting lines to women which supposedly old stereo type stupid males came up with. As a person who lives in an asian country near korea, there's no wonder. Those elements were just disgusting and there was nothing fun to watch this show. I just kept watching it expecting something mindblowing would happen at the end by high scored reviews but NO nothing at all. I just waisted my time."
"Ok first and foremost hear me out, it's Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you're not missing anything."
"For the hype and reviews it is worrisome that the collective thinking sees no issues with this kind of cinematography . The movie industry, Netflix and the South Korean Squid Game series is made to globally desensitize the human population. Violence is presented as normal. The profound perversion of it all that glorifies the sick mind who produces these horrors without regard for the consequences this may bring? A global reception with laughter and excitement. Take some time out and think. There are voices, not only in South Korea that do not take lightly the dangerous degeneracy and wickedness with which Hwang Dong-hyuk fundamentally tainted every child's game. Already we are seeing the growing gangs of kids using violence as a game. The movie industry is not innocent when it comes to social mayhem. We saw the first mass hysteria and destruction of society as a result of the movies during the the William Monroe Trotter era. The cultural advances made by the North were completely destroyed and the South was able to rule the country while Hollywood did its part to facilitate. How movies and the media trigger trends and influence the peace and violence in society is greatly understated. Everyone knows that gambling kills. What is the rational reason behind this corruption of children games turning into a mass slaughter as a sport of the rich labeled as art, set to win nominations? The perversion that Man can hunts animals for sport has now extended into the realm that man can hunt man for sport? With his version of a Squid Game, that is nothing more than a variant of the Hunger Games, Hwang Dong-hyuk biggest achievement is the desensitization of the masses, the numbness of the senses towards violence. Viruses tend to mutate. Mental viruses behave likewise. About the ending, when the gambler fails to board the plane to see his daughter, this is probably the sole scene that adequately describes the suffering of society, the sickness of gambling, loans, artificially induced poverty and the sadism of those that exploit it - beginning with religions-. Apathy is the greatest human disease."
"Make sure watch it its amazing

if u wana more excellent korean series?

I offer u this

flower of evil my dangrus wife goblin & hotel deluna."
"The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don't need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!"
"Listen, having my eardrums busted with the hype surrounding this show I thought I'd give it a go! Authentic yes but there's only so much bloodshed before it becomes a bore. If you've got a few hours to kill give it a shot, overrated, would not be in my top 20 series - box sets!"
"A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience."
"Watched the first episode and its just horrifying. Granted I didn't think i was going to like it because I have a weak stomach for callous killing for the sake of killing, but i figured since it is so popular, there was going to be more to it and perhaps a way of turning such a bleak scenerio into something exciting.

It does not do that. It is just plain awful. The fact that so many people could enjoy watching such hideous and senseless violence makes me think the world really is a bad a place."
"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.

This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.

This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.

I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.

Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.

I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.

Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.

Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.

And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.

And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?

Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?

And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?

And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.

All in all, it was good, but could have been great."
"""Squid Game"" is a show meant to appeal to its viewers twisted inner child. It's not just the games themselves, but the brightly coloured, oversize playground in which the players are forced to live and compete. The storytelling is relatively simple and straightforward. And the satirical elements about the evil billionaires who come to bet on the game can at times feel like how a grade schooler."
"I checked it out after all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this if you haven't seen it. The acting is good, storyline is good, scenery and special effects are good too!"
"The show has an interesting storyline - you can draw various metaphors (about society, capitalism) if you want to, or simply watch something with a different concept. The writing does enough to make you care about the characters.

The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.

All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it. The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining."
"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .

You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha ."
"Very cool Way way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in Borderland

A must watch."
That one episode got me hooked in particular. I rarely binge watch the whole show but I did for this show. There is a reason it is such a mega hit worldwide.
"Keeps you excited, interesting twists and turns throughout the series. And then, then one of the worst and ridiculous endings ever. Last episode destroyed somewhat decent series."
Lot of the things in the story line don't make sense and situations happen abruptly without any context. Characters behavior are not consistent. There are no cliffhanger movements. Simply overrated and lot of hype.
"So, having heard much about this show and of course the controversies, I knew I had to give it a watch.

The show follows 456 players who engage in child like games in order to win £££ prize money, but don't realise how deadly the stakes for the games are!

I found the show to be great for the most part, the games they set for the players are dark and twisted versions of the kids games we all remember from our childhoods, I'm 27 by the way! The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!

The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!

Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!

7/10."
So many twists and turns this show keeps you guessing every episode! It's an amazing show all the way through. Definitely deserves it's spot amongst the Netflix top 10.
"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.

Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game."
"It's been done - and it's been done in better ways. See The Running Man, or Escape from LA. This is teenage waffle trying to appeal to the phone obsessed fickle morals of a younger generation. In that regard it has succeeded.

It is essentially a children's programme with the gore not even being that graphic too. Mix that in with a massively predictable and immature plot (the old man was obviously behind it all) and a ""Luke I am your brother"" Star Wars re-hash crossover (complete with Darth Vader type villain) and mix that with a bit of The Hunger Games and you get this.

The moral side of it is warped too and the main characters - nay, all of the characters remain very unlikeable, annoying and unrelatable. When he dyed his hair green at the end, I knew this was also trying to appeal to the overly geeky anime teens by attempting to create a cool anti hero that could be replicated at the next comic cons.

Overrated."
"This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie."
"This is high octane, edge of your seat! I love Korean shows and movies so I wasn't surprised at the violence, however, the violence was waaaaaaaaay over the top. This show really tugged at the heart strings, only to be slapped in the face with another violent end. All in all, I think the movie is an interesting concept. It sure has twisted my memories of childhood games!"
"09/12/2021, Netflix

I was meaning to watch the squid game for days due to the insane hype it created here at my place. I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.

Again, I don't hate parasite, in the same way, I don't hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.

I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don't you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be 'thrillers' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.

Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character's action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.

I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?

Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?

Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?

Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?

Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn't make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I'm stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.

I'm alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I'll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this."
"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.

It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.

Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead."
"People who are in debt are given a chance to free themselves from their burden and earn simply by playing a series of games. Games they had played as children. But the catch is death to all who fail to complete the mission. This implied there would be a single winner who would take the entire cash prize home. The games tested the players' sense of loyalty, truth and honesty. Though cheating was permitted, the games didn't demand mental prowess, only quick thinking and for certain others brute strength and stamina.

The series houses a well-known cast from the charismatic Lee Jung-Jae to handsome Wi Ha-Joon to the beautiful Jung Hoyeon. But you would find yourself being most empathetic towards Ali. Ali was done a good number by the person he trusted the most. It was the most unkind game in the series. (this would definitely be a game for the card of hearts in Alice in Borderland. P. S. If you loved Squid Game you have to watch Alice in Borderland)

I personally loved the 'Tug of War' game sequence. The gore level is at a 6/10 for me. The series lingers on the absolute need for a season 2 for the unresolved issues of season 1. What happened to No. 29? Will Gi-hun re-enter the games to put a stop to the sadistic butchering pleasure of the investors? Does Gong Yoo have a major role in the entire web of Squid Game?

Psst. The K-drama fan in me literally shouts out: Why no why Gong Yoo, why? In a way I'm thankful he makes a cameo as the charismatic recruiter and not as the Frontman.

I absolutely recommend this series."
"Man who made this and this is so emotional when grandpa knew he was cheating but gave it all up saying ganbu buddies stay and share together and so was ali who paid a price for his innocence.

I wished like every show the good guys has a chance but no this one is realistic as hell.

On episode 6 made me cry i miss my dad seeing gramps .

Bruh they got me in the first half I'm not gonna spoil the spoiler but I did cry for nothing."
The basic idea behind the show isn't really out of the world about how you have to compete to death to gain something but the twisted fact that the show turns children's games to their ugliest and gorriest possible versions makes it a horrifying yet glued to Netflix kind of a watch. You're really missing out if you don't watch this one!
"While this is somehow entertaining, yet there are a lot of boring moments, especially, as stated in other reviews, the terrible acting by half of the total cast.

This show suffers of the repetitive design of many aspects, such as the costume, music, places, even the reaction of the actors.

Also, there is always a boring moment between the games, and that's while the games it self are not epic nor serious but some how they finish it with lots of blood and death..."
"Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.

However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.

Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.

Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.

The first 7 chapters is about the people's misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.

Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.

The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.

The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.

The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.

The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.

In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings)."
Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!
"...and I couldn't even finish it.

Maybe it gets good; I don't know, as it has so much hype and good reviews.

I just know it's not for me.

The main character is so unlikeable that I don't care what happens to him. Maybe he grows as a character...he probably does, but I don't care enough to stick around to see.

The acting is over the top. The main character pulls faces every two minutes. I've seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation.

If I ever watch the rest I'll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass."
"Didn't think much of it, don't understand how it's even trending still and if that has a shop based on the show. Baffles me the most people fight over this in Paris lol."
"This deeply dark and disturbing show dragged on for nine hours, nine damn hours - for what? To show us billionaires shouldn't exist, poverty causes desperation, and capitalism sucks? Really? We needed a poorly conceived none hour saga to show us that? No.

The writer was not only a nihilist, but also constantly spelled out everything the audience is shown - leaving nothing clever, nothing subtle, and nothing original.

I'm very concerned about how well rated this show is. Truly. Y'all concern me."
"With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.

As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.

Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.

Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.

Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again..."
"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting."
"One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals."
"If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch."
"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.

This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch."
Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!
"Honestly, I did not find the point of anything. The games made no sense, killing the people made no sense, the motive behind the games made no sense and the cherry on the cake were the VIPs! ?? Absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a dystopian society then the first hunger hames and the first book maze runner are pretty decent comparatively. But this did not work for me. I need to watch something really nice to chance my mood."
After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.
"If you like shallow, violent, teen-level, badly acted, badly dubbed, pretty much non-sensical drivel, that is derivative of many other movies / series, then this is for you ! Good luck getting your life back (because there are no refunds). I would give this zero...but it won't let me."
The series was really interesting and entertaining till the last half an hour of the last episode. The ending is rubbish.
"Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION Idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series."
Wow!! No show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. It was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. Kept me on the edge of my seat that's for sure. It had me laughing and crying and terrified.
Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn't a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it's a swift watch.
"I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.

South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.

Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films."
Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

SEASON ONE

Seong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.

Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.

It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'

It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****"
"Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie ""As the Gods Will"" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of ""Escape Room"" ""The Cube"" and the ultraviolence of ""A clockwork Orange"" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie's ""Milk Bar"" scene).

Also the English subtitles are awful.

The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming."
"This is a very enticing show that pulls people in with the silly but dark concept on its own, but what makes the show stick out is the strong character relationships that are built out of a bunch of strangers.

I'm a sucker for a good survival show (as proven by my love of The Walking Dead, early Fear The Walking Dead, and The 100) but who actually died in each game was very predictable. Nonetheless each death super emotional and sad. They gave you a reason to care for everyone.

I did not like the plot twist at the ending and while it was cool in some ways, it ruined the shows best scene without giving a proper explanation to anything.

They've set up for a Season 2 on a show that could've finished with a more conclusive singular season. Still, I'm intrigued.

Also, the dub is bad but does not ruin the show, still worth watching either way."
"Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2."
"Poor dialogues, laughably loud melodramatic acting, predictable plot full of plot holes. Another overmarketed overhyped series by Netflix. The ending is laughably bad."
I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.
"I was really enjoying this series until the last episode... it completely threw out the awesome character arc of the protagonist to set it up for a second season when it was obviously supposed to end of a semi-downer ending... which would have been effective and great.

This film isn't that original. It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so ""unique"". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.

Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode..."
"The series uses recurring theme of anime like jujutsu kaisen, btooom and movie like Tournament, Gun Akimbo; tries to put together set of events which are predictable and characters which you cannot relate to. And to make that happen there is very stupid premise of VIPs and debt for which people are ready to kill and die for."
"It was top notch for me till the VIPs came !!! I would rate it 9.0 even more !!!But from when the vips came ,the story didnt feel the same !!!

Set design is awesome and also acting is superb !! I will remember for a long time ,the depressed eyes of Jung hoyeon !"
"A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.

Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.

This is not just another play a game of death story.

Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling."
"I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.

Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched. This episode is depressing, shocking, tender, furious, helpless, funny, intelligent and cunning. Unbelievably good and sick!

Just this episode alone deserves an award for the team.

Overall, it's a great series even though personally i didn't like the last 2 episodes."
"This could have been great. The writing is just really sloppy. I can look past the bad acting from some of the cast because it fits in the Korean and Anime style/genre, but the plot holes and bad writing is a deal breaker. Just one example: in the tug of war episode, they had to break up into teams of 10 ppl. But there is no way there would naturally have been the correct number of people to make exact teams of 10. Just bad writing. It's been hyped a lot. There are lots of these types of instances, but I won't type them all."
"The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.

The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.

As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.

Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season."
The show is just okay. I don't get all of the hype. There are a lot of plot holes and the story doesn't make much sense. There are too many slow motion shots. I think it's because there isn't much of a story. None of the characters are likeable. You never really care about who lives or dies.
"No, it's not fun to watch No, it is not entertaining It is disgusting for the mind

All the crap with awful, silly high school acting.

What did they achieve with this? Views? Big deal.

Learning something? The opposite..."
I was late to the game on this one but I managed to avoid heavy spoilers and man was it worth it. Would recommend to anybody it was just an all around really good times show.
"I've watched a ton of Korean series and films and to say this was good is overstating.

The premise, the storylines are nothing new, it's been done a lot over the years.

Just has more CGI Bells and Whistles.

Sorry, but I can't recommend this slop.

Easy to figure out that The Front Man was the cop's brother... Lots of blood and headshots... I was stunned that the bathroom sex scene was there... None of the characters made you actually like them or pull for them... If they make another season...that's punishment enough."
"This is one of the best shows I've watched. The production quality all around is superb. The directing, cinematography, the script, the overall writing, the cast, and above all, the acting. Every single detail was chosen to perfection. Even watching in English, it's amazingly well-developed. Full 10/10, one of the best shows in years. Go watch it!"
Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.
One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend watching it if you don't mind watching in Korean. The English dub isn't as good as the Korean version so I recommend you watch with English subtitles. Brilliant acting throughout.
"This is a show that asks us a simple question - is mankind inherently good or inherently evil? The answers the show comes up with may surprise you. I loved all nine episodes - it was funny, tragic, violent, and suspenseful. There was some gore in this show - but it wasn't done without catharsis. The acting in this show is just tremendous, especially the lead actor. And the writing is excellent. One of the most important binge shows of our time."
This is a boring series i really dont understand why it is so popular. Adults playing childrens games but they die if they fail... it dont even sound like a good idea.
Nothing else to say but wow. This show had me on edge of my seat for 9 hours. Like a cross of Hunger Games x The Purge and Would You Rather. If you like thriller/suspense this show is for you.
"Seriously, 10/10? A true thriller fan would find this painful to watch."
Muat watch this series this is a gem well written and such a smooth script no boring scenes.
"It gets one extra star for being somewhat creative at times. But otherwise I have no idea how anyone can stand this show.

The main character is so awful and unlikable that it kind of ruins the show from the beginning. Why would we even care if he lives or dies? He's an unbelievably crap person. The acting is atrocious all around. Doesn't matter if you watch it in Korean or dubbed, it's forced like high schoolers trying out for the drama program.

Plot twists? There are a few, but I had no trouble predicting them once the show gave you enough hints.

The ""Game"" itself? Boring and drawn out.

Couldn't finish the show but I heard the last episode sucks anyway."
"With Parasite Korean things ruined by Every Director. They are ""Hollywood Kids"". Everything after ""Swiri"" Korean contends are shadow of American Movies and TV Show. I mean Not a story(some story too) film making. Everything is same. Lighting, editing, camera angles, everything is exactly same. Parasite is the worst result. So Oscar member think it's an American film so it got Oscar with lobby. Squid game is same. Have anyone saw John Woo's 90's movie?? Slow motions are so same I can't tell the which is which. Before mid 90s Korean Movie had very unique. Every director had different film making style. Now?? Nothing but Hollywood film making. I'm so sad Korean contents are just little Hollywood. After chaebul like CJ or Lotte make movie. It just product. Not an art anymore. But nobody cares I'm very sad."
"I don't get the hype for this show, honestly. It's very predictable, and it doesn't feel original. I just feel like I was watching one of the ''Saw'' movies. However, I like the idea behind the show in an apparent criticism of capitalism society and billionaires in general. It can be a very tough reality to confront, but this show portraits the bad side of capitalism in a very depressing and violent way, as it should be.

On the other hand, it's not that hard to criticize capitalism, it's actually a very easy target. It's almost a trend these days, with all other TV shows and movies addressing this topic. I'm not saying it is bad to address this topic at all. I'm really glad this is being discussed, I just feel that this topic isn't enough to make this show original or surprising in any aspect. It's surely not a virtue of this show.

Squid Game tries to build tension on violence and death, just like GOT did. But GOT's tension is genuine, well-built, and really unpredictable (unless you read the books). The tension here is almost useless, since we all know how this is going to end, and the characters death become almost trivial throughout the show. We know who will likely win and who won't. Sure, there are some surprises/plot twists along the way regarding the characters, but it's not that mind-blowing anyway.

Violence scenes are excellent! It's raw, straightforward and merciless. I also liked the cliffhanger in the end. I like how the main character wasn't conformed with all the violent events, and how he evolved to a more mature and dangerous person.

The first season of Squid Game didn't impress me, but there's room to improve in possible future seasons. This show needs another season, not only because of the cliffhanger, but the narrative needs a better outcome, and the main character deserves a better legacy."
"When you watch S01E06 (""Gganbu""), make sure you have a box of tissues next to you... and preferably also somebody to hug."
"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.

What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;

+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.

+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.

+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.

Less enthusiastic about:
some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.



somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?


-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.


the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.


Fun fact
The main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam."
"Everything is bad enough in Squid Game. But the most unbearable thing is to make us believe that this imaginary would not be ideological. But what we are shown is mostly a very bourgeois fantasy that man would be a wolf for man, that the game or the war allow to reinforce. Rancid and pathetic."
"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.

Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.

I highly recommend you to give it a watch!"
"I saw this drama cause I am a Kdrama lover .But it was not for me. From the first till the last episode was reproduced violence in every way. Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.

Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.

In my opinion only the last episode tried to ""save"" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don't bring happiness."
"Overhyped nonsense with a typical K Drama thrown in for good measure.

The story is a carbon copy of several other Netflix shows, including a Japanese tv show from a few years back The acting is way overexaggerated and borderline cheesy The setup is completely nonsensical and the atmosphere in the film, except for a few moments, is poorly done.

The only reason this show got the exposure it got is because of the enormous amount of marketing it received from Korean conglomerates. This was advertised on every bus and taxi in Seoul for months.

If you're going to be copying a typical battle royale formula, at least make it original."
"The idea starts quite well (even though it is nothing new) but it becomes predictable after the 2nd episode and it contradicts itself quite often even though the premises are simple.

I was expecting a mind-blowing series but it did not reach my expectations. Quite disappointing even though the acting by the ""players"" is really good and some scenes are have a surprising sceneray with a carefully chosen color palette.

On top of that the ending does not make any sense whatsoever."
"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.

The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors."
"Everyone gave their best except for the VIPS.

Great series to watch Hats off to the director!"
"Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show."
"I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done."
"The main characters are all unlikable, in the extreme. And all the acting is terrible, and voice acting in translation somehow even worse.

I have no idea how this became a success."
"This is another version of The Hunger Games. Contestants are killed without knowing there is a death result from Green Light, Red Light. The majority choose to leave so they go. However a lot come back for the second contest, willingly.

The contestants play against each other in a survival of the fittest contest. They play Korean children games, killing each other.

If your ""friend"" was going against you for money, would they kill you?"
It had good moments till vip episode but overall games sucked and too childish and then the ending and last few episodes sucked..........................
Its amazing. Just stop reading reviews and start watching now.
"Literally had to stand up from my coach and pace, it's so intense and very well done!"
"One of the amazing series I have ever watched, day after day the Korean drama proves to be the best. If you are feeling bored because of repetitive ideas of Hollywood drama just watch Squid Game, the idea is just fresh in the packet, the actors are very capable, even the music is perfect. You can't just simply ignore the next episode, it is like addiction you will continue to watch??"
I really loved this shot series best series of the uear no question asked but the ending kinda bad but overall fantastic.
"Highly disappointed. The show started great but the ending is stupid as hell. I feels like I wasted my time watching this because so many things were left out. I am assuming there is another season into play but so far, I am giving it a solid three. I'll come back and change my review once they fix this crap."
Every episode they took morea than anything efforts to make such a great show. I love this show and all the characters made this show a very well. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for working for this series. Loved it and i can watch it again and again.
An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...
"Great show with great twists. The only thing that I found bad was the VIP's terrible acting.

The only Korean show that I have watched and it was amazing."
Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.
"I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately."
"The plot makes almost zero logical sense, but the show itself was still enjoyable, even in a comical way. The characters are shallow and lack any realistic motivations, so it's hard to feel anything for the story. I thought it looked pretty nice though, and in general the pacing was decent."
"First of all. I like Korean cinema. Memories of murder and Burning are among my top 10 favorite films of all time.

The show has been hyped everywhere and I actually didn't want to see it right away. But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.

I try to make it simple and I don't make it up.

I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.

I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.

Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.

Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.

And this goes along with every thing in the show.

Examples:

Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would've been funnier if it didn't work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn't an important character.

The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would've loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would've been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he's safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn't happen.

Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn't find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would've like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn't happen.

The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.

To me it really went difficult when the 'VIPs' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn't barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should've been introduced earlier. They weren't even needed at all. If you'd take them out it wouldn't have changed anything and it would've even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn't match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.

And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.

I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn't even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It's like having a French character and calling him 'Guy Frenchman'.

However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff. And I will watch the second season if it comes. I also liked ""Sweet Home"" which is also a Korean show with monsters and all around one house. It kind of went nowhere in the end, but I actually liked that one more."
"I don't know why the show gets so much praise internationally. I mean overall it's a really bingeable show, but there's really nothing much aside from that. In my country, the show receives so many polarized comments, with people either loving it badly or hating it with passion.

The game master said that the game is created so that those mistreated in the outside world will be treated equally in the game, and yet the master himself did not get shot when he lost the game (voluntarily or not). In the ""walking on glass"" game, when one candidate knew how to tell tempered glass from normal glass, the front man turned off all the lights just to make the game more entertaining to the VIPs, effectively rendering the poor man unable to use his skills. I guess it's still much advantageous to be rich and powerful even in the so-called equal game, hah?

The main character is horrible. He's a loser with no character development throughout the movie. He's described as a person that has so much compassion and empathy with others, yet in the end he didn't even bother visiting his daughter in the US - all because of some nonsense triggering comments from the front man. And gosh he wouldn't even have kept his promise to the North Korean defecting girl to take care of her brother had it not been for the call from the organizer. Such a f*cked-up man who I have no sympathy for.

There are so many other flaws in the movie that I don't have time to bother mentioning. All in all, a movie with good intentions and palatable cinematography, but horrendous execution. If you like death-game shows, better watch Alice in Borderland, Jinrou Game, the Incite Mill, Liar Game, or many that actually make you use your brain to figure out how to escape your ill-fated situation and don't annoy you with hypocritical mouthings."
This is definitely the most diverse drama I've watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.
"This! This is what I've been looking for! ""Escape room"" style stories have become my favorite since Alice In Borderland, although I've been exposed to stories like this with Battle Royale. The story made us feel very attached to even the smallest characters that we get heartbroken for their deaths. Nicely written emotional value and dramatic essence about children's games."
"There is a lot of gore, of course, and you will definitely cry at some point of the show, probably twice at least. Still, it's a fantastic show that I highly recommend watching (not with the English dub though, because it sounds very goofy)."
"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.

I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10."
"This show drags. I beg of you to skip episode two altogether.

We're here to watch the people play the games and die. I don't care about all of these absolute whiny little girls and their annoying problems.

I'll admit, I'm watching with English dubs. It's just like anime. It sounds over-acted and annoying. All the women in this show sounds beyond annoying.

This show shines when it focuses on the games and the storytelling slightly before and after the games. Everything else is drawn out. I wonder if it's because it's a tv show. A movie would have gotten all of this out of the way and then play ball!

There are some great diamonds hidden under an abundance of rocks. If you can hold out, then you can enjoy some great scenes. If you have zero patience though, do yourself a favour and hope they make a movie version."
"Pros * interesting premise * atmospheric * some of the acting is very well done * some character development is well done

Cons * character personalities change at random * some over the top acting * some overly stereotypical characters * premise doesn't have any real foundation * it ignores the potential sociocultural insight

Pros The story underneath it all is an interesting one. The same general idea isn't a unique one (eg. It's similar to Brazil's ""3%""), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.

The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It's definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.

Cons But that's all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.

There's some decent acting and character development as well, but it's way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and 'tantrums') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.

By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.

In addition to this, there's so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what ""3%"" does really well). But the dialogue doesn't really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.

Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end."
"..but entertained from the very beginning until end of season 1.

Interesting story, great act (except of the crazy woman and the VIP's - really annoying) However I've enjoyed each episode!"
"POSITIVES :-

First, the CONNECTIONS between two characters are plotted so nice.

Second, the STORY PLOTTING is also good except in episode 2.

Third, the BGM also performed his work amazingly. It supported the visuals so nicely.

Fourth, ACTING done by each character is very natural.

Fifth, i love the INNOCENCE shown in movie, specially of two characters - main character and that old man.

Sixth, as i wrote in title, CINEMATOGRAPHY is lifeline of this movie. I am unable to describe it.

Seventh, the SETS are also amazing, i like the place where those games held.

Eighth, i love the GORE SCENES that are shown in the movie, specially that first kill in the first game. Omg, that gave me so pleasure.

Ninth, the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is also good.

NEGATIVES:-

First, the STORY of the movie is so WEAK & PREDICTABLE. The story is said to be the soul of any series. But squid doesn't focus on this.

Second, i know that the series doesn't kill its main character, so we already know the game results from the beginning that the main character doesn't lose. Still series stretch the length of the game unnecessarily.

Third, there are so many FILLER SCENES which can be easily removed.

Fourth, plotting of DEATHS are not so Impactful. I can't feel anything.

Fifth, it is so DRAMATICAL in some episodes. And i don't like drama so much.

Sixth, the last episode gives me so much irritation because i expected that all the mysteries were solved in this episode. But this web series doesn't give a satisfying explanation of the game like who is the owner or head behind this, and why did they do it and how it can be hidden from all governments of the world etc.

That's all from my side."
"Just a silly scenario, with a big investment, and a cheesy end. Please stop comparing it to Casa de Papel."
"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.

But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.

More, more, more please."
"I really don't get why everybody's gushing over this piece of mediocrity. Honestly, it does not deserve the 8.6, and it does not deserve all the hype around it. There wasn't anything original or anything others hadn't done better before. I'd give it a 5/10, for being perfectly average if it stole only 2-3 hrs of my life rather than a whopping 9, but here we are. I kept watching in the hopes that something crazy was about to happen, right until the end, that justified all the craze, and was left disappointed when it finally ended. Give it a pass if you have anything slightly better than average to watch instead."
The series is so good and so emotional it is itself the first series i watched in korean. Highly recommended!
"As another review says, the VIPs acting is not bad. The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.

I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.

As for the show, it is a great show. I strongly recommend watching it.

Maybe not a 10/10 as that is reserved for films that changed my life, but definitely a 8/10.

It is a great metaphor of capitalism and how our society forces people into extreme situations."
"This show is great so far. It has a cool mystery and style BUT the reason I believe it's so popular is because of its anime style concept. This show has an outlandish concept style that isn't popular in typical American media but is very popular in anime. I believe this show is so popular because everyone who loves anime likes the show. Not just that but those who have never seen anime because of stigma but would enjoy the medium LOVE this show because it's the first thing they have seen like it. Everyone is raving about this show because they have never seen anything like it (except for us anime watchers). I believe this show's popularity represents a huge shift in entertainment. I think this will be a gateway for it's fans into other non-American entertainment forms, most specifically anime."
"What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc.

The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn't matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT."
"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show."
I fast forwarded it after episode 4. Didn't have the time and energy to go through each and every boring scene of this show just to know the ending. Shouldn't have listened to my friend whi said its a great show.
"Deserve more like a 8 but the 1/10 ''wahhh everyone like it but not me, I'm special'' are so annoying so I give a 10 to compensate a bit.

Good actors, good characters, very original idea. Yea the VIP are weird but don't put a serie 1/10 because of some weirdos characters.

Yea there is some moral, so, is it a crime? People these days..."
"The Old Man being the main guy - hmm... There are hints throughout the show btw. In the Green Light, Red Light he was the one who just triumphantly walked among the people trembling with fear after the ""K-Anabelle(lol)"" doll starts shooting.

He smiles as he is enjoying the moment. But they wouldn't kill him because as we saw he wouldn't be killed after the Marbles Game, he still lives.

So, maybe there was no stake for him, I guess or maybe there was... that's why he volunteered to play. Or maybe just for fun of it, you know - as he says.

Even in marbles episode, he is shown as a planner to trick 456 just to see if he tries to use the 'dementia' of an 'helpless' old man, even if he is considered a good friend. But he went out as a kind, loving grandpa kind of way. That's why the twist - that he was the Mastermind bums most people. But he is a planner, a great one. I am not judging if he is a smart guy, should be an evil one. Just saying after the series shows he was.

Just take this as a fun read, I guess. Umm, bye."
"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.

So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.

""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?"
This show was amazing...What the beautiful show understand ing and the game of the people money playing game and earn money...And money this show was good in this game show...Good acting good camera work good direction.
"Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit's a level of tension few other series have. It's not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.

Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.

Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.

The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children's games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.

One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.

Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it's the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.

Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending."
"Dramatic uniform, dramatic instagrammable masks. The plot is so forced. Nothing is thrilling. Too overrated i think."
"A total disappointment, for starter..so much hype only to become famous for something been said older in the days..top knots b$$it if you want my honest opinion, lost almost a day watching the whole thing,no twist if you pay attention to the plot and not the perversion in multiple scenes."
"Guys.

How can this show even be hyped ?

It's easily in my top 5 of the worst series I've ever watched. I'm totally not kidding. I wasted 9 hours of my life for this trash, just to understand why people like it. And I don't get it. It's bad. It's more than bad. It's boring, it's predictable.

And I'm not even talking yet about the absolute ridiculous acting.

100% trash - at least for people with a little claim in good series. Trust me..."
"Predictable, boring, distasteful

I watched this show because everyone was talking about it. My brother and father both told me it was great. I watched the first 2 episodes and I thought ""Alright maybe it needs time"".

Then I watched the other 2 and I knew exactly what was hound to happen after.

The plot was boring, the side stories were completely useless and the acting was below par. Don't watch it."
"With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.

There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. ""Memories of the Alhambra"" and ""Sysiphus"" are much more intelligent in their script."
"All netflix show is over rate

overrated and overrate."
"This show is something else. Even when you think there might be a happy ending for the lead character - he discovers something that will change his world forever. In all my years I have never seen anything like this - this takes the film idea of the Parasite unto a whole other dimension, and unfortunately with debt rising - I can see this happening. Watch, learn, think..."
"I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it's not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interesting

However, once the VIP's arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the ""acting"" and dialogue of the VIP's was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn't properly resolved

Whilst the finale wasn't terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they'd done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the ""reveal"" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.

It's a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch."
"Forget about people complaining about the acting of the VIP characters, the acting overall was bad. It was distracting, took you out of the scene and was unintentionally humorous.

I didn't care much for the characters. I wasn't interest in them. They obviously wanted you to care about the old man but frankly I found him annoying and was hoping he would die and get off the screen ASAP.

One of the big ""reveals"" you can see coming a mile away. The other, you likely won't see coming but I didn't care much when it happened.

I wouldn't have made it through the series if I didn't fast forward and skip boring parts... and there were quite a few."
"The idea of the show is interesting, but overall is really boring. I had to skip more than half of the show... There are so weird things, like the actor who speaks with food in his mouth 20 minutes and he is not chewing the food. It's really disgusting.

In general, the acting was really bad. Exagerated. Theatrical. I know that in asia this is kinda normal, but you can't take it seriously.

And the most important thing. Why would you copy the famous trade mark of la casa de papel? They have almost the same jumpsuit, the guns and of course they have masks too. Embarrassing.

Korean Hunger Games in La casa de papel costum. Copy-cat. ""Veeery creative"". Pathetic."
"I mean..if you have nothing else to binge watch then sure..but I found myself fast forwarding the show because it was excruciatingly slow. Also, extremely predictable and no surprises anywhere...what's the hype all about?"
"It's visually appealing, and I can get past the bad acting, but the broken storylines are enough to ruin it for me. Wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend."
"This is a very strange series. It's like a cross between Logan's Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M. C. Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....

But seriously...WTF!!!!!

The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don't know.

I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their ""winnings"" from how they were acquired? And while the ""1 year later"" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but I don't think I really care .

Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone. And wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It's a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.

However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky's waltz from ""Serenade for Strings"", Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" and ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.

But again, seriously......WTF!!!

P. S. How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?"
"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.

Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all."
"Rating: 8

This show was identical to Money Heist in so many ways. The costumes, the plot, the way how people tackle situations and obviously Netflix. Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.

This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.

I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn't find the plot as completely new and offbeat."
"This drama has it all. The series highlights social issues while following a big group of desperate people trying to pay off their debts in a deadly game that entails children games turn bloody, lured in by a promise of big money.

The simple question is how far would people go for a lot of money when they can't pay their debts. The secondary question barely touched is who would get a kick out of the killing."
"One of the best shows I've ever watched, I hate the VIPs though."
"First of all, this review will contain heavy spoilers from the get go so stop reading if you haven't watched the show.

Let's begin wtih a simple question. Can it all be justified? I am not trying to defend psychotic violence and sadism as well depravity of a satanist-looking cult full of rich boys billionaires but...

As the old man finally said the obvious: They did it all on their own volition. They knowingly signed the rules. THEY chose to abide by it.. Further they could put an end to it anytime they wanted with majority voting.

Also let us isolate one incident. The pancake game. If we set aside the GI Joe soldiers who - mind you- were always cordial, polite and abided by the rules such as to eliminate those who reveal face or take out the literal trash who chose to break the rules in their little hooligan clique of organ harvest... It remains to a fine testament that a self-declared 'dimwit' loser who lives with his Mother can achieve the impossible - ie solving the umbrella puzzle with a literal gun pointed to his head. It's almost Campbellesque hero's epic and akin to a rite-of-passage transformation of handling a hot iron rod.

So despite the psychotic riot mayhem and meaningless killing from day 1, this shows that conditions were more than fair. Afterall no one can take that confidence and self-efficacy he learned under the crucible. In fact, the conditions were ""MORE"" fair than real world.

If we buy this lock, stock and barrel.. then it answers as to WHY this senseless violence can be justified. Whereas the cruel outside world kicks people to the curb, here is a perfection opportunity of harmony in anarchy with soldiers in consort with managers acting as the great equalizers.

The final window scene was the ultimate culminating point and great capstone to this otherwise bitter critique of capitalism. Yes, many people read the obvious scathing attack on it, and even a Washington Post article highlighted the irony of the fact that they are basking on the same pile of money enabled by the very system they criticized.. But but I don't think it that black and white.

If anything, that scene (as well as the previous powerful scene of 'brother' sparing 'brothers' life...) serves as a striking footnote and glaring closure to the triumph of humanity and compassion.

Yes, life is cruel. Yes, capitalism enables the powerful and rich to exploit the ones lower at the bottom if not ask for fellatio whilst people are dying like race horses in a bloodsport. Yes, it is a dog-eat-dog world outside....

But at the same time like the ever-cliche rose climbing out of stone, so is the power and magic of humanity, hope and love.

(And that brings the point even closer to me. I felt I could relate with the protagonist having found myself in a similar situation although priveleged to live in SoCal. But despite living the simple life, I am also aware that eventhough it may seem to be a cruel world out there, it is also a serene one. What would really happen if entire Earth was reduced to a prison as a social experiment? Sans minor glimpses of riots and ever-concurrent wars... human in general are peaceful and righteous. Even though our planet sustains of globalist capitalist economy, look outside the window... Do you see people devolving to their base and depraved instincts? No...Because despite all our flaws, humanity still has the spirit of God within.)

Thus in a way, it manages to do the opposite - instead of dissecting the capitalistic eschatology to shards, it drives home the point and highlight that even if human were put in a situation where you are pitted against another for a huge pile-uh-cash, you would still choose compassion over violence. Even if a homeless person is dying on the street, there is still a kind and gentle soul watching over you like guardian. Even if you earn money through a slipknot of violence, you still preserve your humanity and look after those childhood gradnma-aunt who took care of you and took you under their wing like their own son. These.. these values can never be traded no matter how corrupt and diseased our moral compass may seem to reveal otherwise on the exterior. Albeit all it takes a flake of wainscot to break the tipping point and start riots and anarchy as seen from real life and the movie Joker, but under all the seeming inhumanity and cruelty resides a powerful, calm Shiva.

On a separate note, this movie also exploded our blinkers as to what Korean lifestyle, culture and movies are about after year after year and movie after movie of kung-fu tropes and what not. It shattered mine at least.. and I never bought the hype mistaking it for being cringy as BTS. Haha...

What does blinkers mean anyway..."
"Squid Games realises

That even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .

Billioner thinks common man are like horse to whom we can do gambling & make ""FUN"" by using them .

Many ppl will do buttering/use you when they need something , but same ppl will throw you OUT they have same power in thier hands."
"You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!

This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.

All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.

I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.

But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...""Can money buy you happiness?"". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?

There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long)."
"Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...

This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.

The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.

I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...

Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with."
"I was so hyped to watch this because everywhere I went, people were talking about it. My expectations were set high by the internet community, but the internet community often doesn't know anything. This was mediocre, 6* show, but I'm giving it 2*, because of all the people that gave it 10*. I was so disappointed when it ended, because they never explained anything."
"I tried to give it a watch I heard nothing but excitement over this show so I decided to see what the fuss is all about and I don't understand. I couldn't even make it 20 minutes into this mess. Robbing old ladies, gambling problems. And blood fetish from the mafia? Insanely boring I couldn't even keep my attention up enough for them to get to playing the ""games"" I heard they do in this show. Disappointing."
"People are overestimating this series in a way never seen before, it's just an average series, basically this series takes several movies and series and mixes them all together, the only game that's really interesting to watch is the first one."
"Is this original? To play a game and having your life at risk? No.

Go and watch ""The Cube"", ""Saw"", Hunger Games "",... etc.

It started ok, but i think it lacked an original ending. Having a rich guy betting on people life's was an expected ending. The movie ""Hostel"" already touched this point, having people kidnapped to allow the rich to kill them.. ""entertain the rich in a sadistic way"".

Each episode nothing new appeared, more and more stupid kid games... just got worse.

Season 2 will be just rewind and repeat with diff people and diff games (don't expect anything new)"
"Netflix K-drama might offer nothing new as a survival-show dystopian thriller but deft writing and fine craftsmanship made it worth the hype even for international audience. Some gratuitous violence over nail-biting twists and turns kept our interest till the end.

Each contestants for some reasons had purposes due to rounded character developments. They took 'companionship' to next level including shocking revelations we could barely see. Convincing ensemble cast effectively triggered audience to pick sides in every deathly familiar games.

My most to leave fave: 1. Tug of War 2. Glass Bridge 3. Red Light Green Light 4. Honeycomb Shape Cutting 5. Squid Game 6. Marble Games."
"We go through all the emotions in front of this series.

One of the best show ever made, Netflix or otherwise."
Acting is horrible and you can fast forward through half of it and still understand what's going on. Some of the games are interesting. Some take forever for no reason.
"I didn't think the lead actor was likeable in the first episode but found myself rooting for him after episode 2. The games were so creepy. Children's games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there's a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i'll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors."
"It is worth watching.

The first season was awesome. Interesting concept. The problem is, that a lot of it is predictable."
"The show is so popular for what? It isn't even that good. The story line was poor and the plot twist too. It also make no sense at all. It was only popular Bcz it's on Netflix and the actor Wi ha joon and hoyeon jong r pretty and hot. Theire acting isn't bad but not the best. I watch it till the end and at first it wasn't that bad and it could've been better but it just got worse. There r sm k dramas that deserve more hype like sweet home, the penthouse, hotel del luna etc."
"This show will keep you interested from start to finish. Very well written, set designs were incredible, and the ending was brilliant!

Only negative I have from it is the same as a lot of other reviews. The VIP's were horrendous at acting!

Power through those scenes because it's worth it."
"Battle Royal meets Belko Experiment with some SAW vibe twist at the end, that's all I'm saying if you have seen those 3 films this is the show combined. I have nothing negative to say this show was so well done and hope to see a second season soon!"
"Good but not as much as people talk about it.

Could be ended in lesser episodes.

For me it's a overrated series. You won't miss a lot if you don't watch it."
"Every little while a massive hit pops out out of nowhere on Netflix. Black mirror, Stranger things, etc. Squid Game is the new addition of those timeless masterpieces."
"All the praise for this ""brilliant"" series, full of ""original"" ideas. Go read The Long Walk and The Running Man by Richard Bachman (i.e. Stephen King). The Long Walk was the first novel he wrote (but not the first of his that was published)...it's over 50 years old, and was published over 40 years ago. Nearly everything this series is built on can be found there in a simpler format."
I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.
"Probably one of the most cliché, ""battle royale"" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked."
"The thing is, for me at least, I had to ""forgive"" much of the script, there are big plot holes in the series that one has to just overlook to make it to the end and give it such high ratings.

Don't get me wrong, I get this is not supposed to be taken literally, and some suspension of disbelief is necessary for most syfy series, but you have to be consistent with your own premise.

(Side note, sorry if there're mistakes/misspellings, somethings up with my app it seems.)"
"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.

But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement."
"To many similarities with The Hunger Games. The contestants do have a choice whether to participate, though.

Too many plotholes as well."
"Fly Me to the Moon Let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like on A Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand In other words, baby, kiss me

Now imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.

A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.

However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.

Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10

**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**

Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season."
Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.
"I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.

But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.

I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it ""suspiciously popular"". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be ""hip"", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current ""cool"" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense).

Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it ""in spite of some plot holes"").

At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.

This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.

The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden ""Player 1"" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.

There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.

Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It's not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn't the same as Plot Armor.

My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing.

Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's ""cool"" or not. Still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message.

I'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse. (My generation isn't much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I'm truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go ""Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"""
"Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn't stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising."
"After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.

I don't know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It's always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.

Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can't get even worse) and there's almost nothing for me.

Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.

Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty ""The Wailing"" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics), Japan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.

Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can't seem to get into the culture.

One example is the character of Min-Yeo.

Sure, on the surface, she's a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.

The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to ""belong"". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to ""entice"" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.

I actually didn't hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn't sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn't feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.

I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It's our actions that make us either good or bad.

Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don't seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don't see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It's more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.

Don't you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn't seem happy about his winnings.

And Battle Royale... it's similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it's all about punishment. Squid Game isn't about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It's their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.

Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it's been so successful is that although it is almost ""normal"" for Korean or Asian movies to ""not end happy"", Western audiences aren't used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn't have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.

The fact that it doesn't end in such a ""perfect"" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It's just more like actual life."
"What could I say about this overly budgeted piece of horrid excuse of a series. The story isn't very original, the plot and dialogue are very dull, boring and just bad. The most thrilling part of an episode is when it ends. The characters are unoriginal and poorly acted. I could go on but I will not be tearing my eyes out anymore and waste another thought with this.

If someone can enjoy this I would like to know what it is that makes this even barely something to waste time on. If there's something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real. Although when the props were involved, that ""joy"" faded away faster than it began and made it impossible to ever feel immersed to the world.

Unwatchable. Wouldn't recommend."
"Squid Games' is the finest web series you can watch today on Netflix. And, if you are a fan of South Korean cinema, you will love every bit of it. They arguably produce the highest quality films in the world.

Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!!"
"Meh. At best. I really don't see why this has become a thing. The dialog is childish, the acting is horrendous, the plot is predictable, the pace is slow, the choices are unrealistic and the story is common. So what's the big deal about this mess?"
"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.

I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.

To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.

Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2."
"Loved every minute, couldn't stop watching!

They did a great job in making it feel more ""realistic"" and not like SAW or some other classic horror/thriller movie."
"Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae not my Greg Chun.

Kindly edit the cast."
"Watch one Episode you have seen it all.

This is nothing special, and so predictable, definitive a no brainer nothing more."
"Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated."
"This series isn't overrated to me. It's what I needed to see.

"Thoroughly enjoyed this show, waaaay out there, but so out there it was truly captivating!"
"This is by far the Worst TV Show in the History. Congratulations, Netflix should win a prize for the most boring and the most poorly written snooze fest of a ""show"". I've heard that Netflix was bad but I didn't knew it was This bad. Boring. Yep everyone was right when they said #CancelNetflix."
"This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it."
"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.

Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.

Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.

Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.

Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.

Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.

With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.

Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.

Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!"
"Watched due to all the hype but the storyline is bad and predictable, the acting is horrible and very exaggerated, there are no likable characters, the dialog is idiotic, and the series is violent for the sake of violence. Worst series we've seen in awhile."
"Let's start with the Korean drama that took the world by storm in 2021. I enjoyed this Korean drama, along with many others. However, I felt like it fell flat in the last few episodes. It comments on social status, financial status, and how humans treat one another are hard-hitting. The idea there are people in such financial struggle they would risk their and other people's lives is heart-breaking, yet eye-opening. The incorporation of well-known children's games is a great device used by the creator to connect the audience to the characters. Reminding them of their childhood but also understanding the stress and difficulties of playing these games with such high stakes. I will say the poor acting from the English actors did break the illusion for me, and also ended, which I will not share with those of you that are yet to watch. If you are not a fan of horror and gore I do not recommend this K-Drama for you, another wise I think it's a brilliant watch, but 100% watch in Korean with Subs...Dub is not good."
"The first episode is so packed and dense with brilliance that even though it's only a hour long it felt like a full complete movie in and of itself, yet I was unable to look away the entire time it was that good."
"This show was phenomenal. I didn't start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn't seem super interesting. It didn't appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn't match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don't know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn't figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn't amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. I've talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn't just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.

If you haven't already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won't regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending."
"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!"
"Boring, predictable, sometimes ridiculous.... Managed to watched it all though, but still.... There are much better Series out there!

Skip that one."
The description says the players are vying for $45 billion dollars but the amount is really 45 billion Korean won or about $30 million USD.
"Complete garbage soap, shallow and vapid characters, interactions, dialogue, garbage cinematography and picture quality, godawful choreography and camerawork. Scenes and setting both looking like haphazard trash, while also being excessively extended and serving no purpose at all. The show simply capitalizes on vulgarity and shock factor to attract lowbrow audiences."
"And I'm hard to please!

Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.

So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.

But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.

However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.

And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.

And what a ride.

No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.

The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.

Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it."
"Typical Korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure.

Was good to see a non Korean, Ali Abdul, in this.

Thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world."
"Wow, this got off to such a great start and sustained it for 6 episodes. I liked it so much that I binge watched it. Then in episode 7 it did a face plant!! As many reviewers mention: the VIPs are unbearably ridiculous and painful to watch. But in addition to that, in my opinion, the ending is ridiculous!! Such a let down to what was a glorious series. Sorry I wasted any time at all on it!"
"This movie is sooooo overrated, it's a blatant plagiarism from Japanese movies like ""As the Gods will"", ""Liar Game"", ""Friend Game"", and the final twist is a piece of a popular series name Saw.

The director of the film even stated that As The Gods Will was created in the 2010s, after his initial idea for Squid Game, but if he had to say it, he would say he did it first.

Seriously? He make a movie that has a lot of stuff copied from movies that came out years ago and say he made it first by his idea?!? You think audiences are stupid?

You create something after someone else, you have to make it different otherwise you are just a copycat of other people's work and effort. You can't just copied and say ""I made it first because I had the idea in mind first."" It's ridiculous!

Stealing other people's work and make it your own it's dirty and unacceptable in the modern world, a really talented, self-respecting director would definitely never do that."
"I'm just gonna say this right off the bat, Ali deserves better. Period. That scene where Sangwoo betrayed him got me clutching my pearls and choking on air. I've never been one to watch K-series, and this series got me hooked! The acting is exceptional for all Korean characters EXCEPT the VIPs. What in the name of Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers was going on with their horrendous, cold, bleak acting?

Aside from that, I appreciate how realistic and simple the plot is, but it is so well-developed. The one fact that hits hardest for me is the fact that if this game was to take place tomorrow, people would actually partake in it. Even more so, the same betrayals and back stabbing would happen too. Something chilling about that fact to me."
"We've seen every element of this before. My wife and I sat here predicting how every single scene would play out. The acting, while carried by a few good performances, was uninspiring and the lack of character development made it hard to care for the fates of anyone in the show. More enjoyment came from retranslating the poor subtitles than actually following the story."
"Being a fan of Korean cinema I was intrigued by this series and over the weekend became addicted to each episode. I was especially intrigued as I know Jung Ho-Yeon from the fashion industry and worked with her on many fashion shows. Didn't know she could act as well as she did and look as unattractive that her role called for. The only but for me was the VIPS and the manner in which they were portrayed. It was vulgar, crude and racist and a total turn off for me."
"I tried, I really did. After reading so many positive reviews on the series, I gave it a try. Not just once...Overacting, seen mostly in Chinese kung-fu flicks, hit me after 15 minutes. So I quit. But not quite, since my kids loved the show, and I gave it another try, watching complete 1st episode and half of the 2nd one. That's when I could not stand it any longer. The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember. The point is: this crap of a series pretends to deliver some kind of message on greed, and people in need doing things they normally would never do... But it simply does not deliver, at least not to me. Been there, seen this somewhere."
"I sat for months, waiting for the next amazing Korean show, being extremely ""Sweet Home""sick (I'm a dad, I'm allowed to make dad jokes.) Squid game popped up mid September, and I thought... maybe!

But nope.

Now I have to review it because, for whatever reason, it got popular recently.

The visuals were great.

Therein lies the positives.

Now for the negatives.

First off, stop calling it a Korean drama. It's not. (Of course, neither is Sweet Home.) It's a drama/thriller made in Korea for Americans. Korean dramas are a completely different genre.

It starts with the same premise we've read a billion times. The 13 tzametti, Truth or dare, question of ""how far would you go for money?"" Likewise answered with the basic premise inspired by The Most Dangerous Game.

From this non original start... it actually devolves. It devolves into a shallow Battle Royale, with false (and woefully unoriginal) social commentary delivered with a lack of subtlety that would make Andrew Ridker jealous. Then ends with a disappointing attempt at an altruism message. We saw, I swear, more depth in the Hunger Games series. Take that as you will.

I know, seeing the success of the MCU, that people like their literary themes shoved in their faces these days, rather than delivered in a real story, and on that account, I can say Squid Game did superb work.

I rarely ask for true originality, because I know there is nothing new under the sun, but if you make me a PB&J, and make a spectacle out of it, like you invented it, I hate you.

If you want good Korean television with real (albeit, at times, also not so subtle) social commentary, just wait for season 2 of Sweet Home with me.

Last notes: Acting is distractingly inconsistent, the characters aren't real people (I mean, the caricatures,) and the ""twist"" may be effective if you've never read a book or seen a movie."
"Was genuinely looking forward to watching what I had been led to believe was a bonefide classic. What a huge disappointment. Dreadful acting, appalling dialogue and just boring beyond belief. Dont believe the hype, this is utter rubbish."
"Squid Game is a different type of show and I'm all for it! I really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. I thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. I avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and I'm glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you.

I definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways.

Check it out! Now on Netflix!"
"A five for the main story a 1 for the ending, like people said it does try to somewhat act like ""SAW"" at some point.

Also the subtitles was way off.

If I had to watch again... I wouldn't Some episodes was interesting, but most was not and like I said the ending was awful and doesn't make sense."
Addictive show. A lot of violence. Morality and immorality. The version dubbed into English takes away from the show. Watch it in Korean with subtitles.
"I adored this show, the colour theme was absolutely phenomenal and so aesthetic YET terrifying, however... the VIP's could not act, but i'm not going to let the VIP's spoil the entire show."
"It is hard to understand how or why a show like this got the Green Light (pun intended). The only characters that seem believable, or even remotely interesting, are the ones that are NOT involved with the ""game"".

If this is the #1 show on Netflix at the moment then I strongly suggest that someone test the water supply."
"SQUID GAME is a series with a lot of common with HUNGER GAMES in other words it is like hunger game with more fantastic and weird challenges ..

The thing that Iliked was the message that it offers

''Money do not bring happiness'' and that people can kill their friend for the sake of money it has an intresting plot and actor's performances are good too i was also burst into tears in ep 6

BUT there are some disadvantages that should be taken into account ...

such as there are tooo many violence scenes that should not exist in my opinion and some plotwist that i had already expected them .

The issue with the policeman at the begging was intresting and i thought that he may help competitors to escape but he did not do something important to the plot , he could not to exist or be somehow different.

Finally it has a weak ending .. it could be better .

To my mind there are such a lot masterpiece of Korean industry and this one is not one of them but i reccomend to watch it only if you are 18+"
Seong is going to the squid game again with his red hair but already has his money won for the first time but after losing all of his friends and his brother he blames himself because the death of her mother will he's gonna make it again.
"This is definitely a special show and I was hooked from the very beginning with the first game played. While some plot elements are somewhat obvious with who the winner will be because of the main character being established early on, there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Plus, the directing style with the camera work, choice of colors, set designs, editing, etc was very artistic and noteworthy. The acting from a few specific characters as well deserves praise, I greatly enjoyed the show and always couldn't wait for more!"
"Acting is so bad almost hard to believe these are some actors.

My elementary and middle school kids saying everyone in school talks about it, so is this for soon to be teenage audience? No too much violence yet American kids are watching it like mcdonal of tv shows."
"I LOVED this show, you can binge-watch it, it's addictive.

I don't like horror and blood, but this one was more of a thriller-suspense, even I liked it.

It's a mix of: the chess scene from the first Harry Potter, Black Mirror and The platform.

It's very hard to guess what's coming next, it keeps you interested and guessing."
I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.
"Squid Game is a barbaric, dramatic, and intense indictment of modern capitalism with very in-your-face demonstrations of poverty, power, and ruthless murder. The acting and the script makes the whole thing come alive and certain episodes, particularly episode 6 and 8, had me on the verge of tears. If you watch them you will understand why. The show has some flaws, mainly some unneeded sex scenes and some questionable plot points. However it hits all the right beats and became the mass hit that it has by demonstrating the ruthless sociopathy of capitalism. This is summed up best at the end with the justification for Squid Game: it was fun."
"I enjoyed the show up until the ending, I knew the premise of it before beginning it, its a hunger games and survival show. I wanted to know the why of it, it's the reason I decided to watch. I found it a bit violent, but it had great visuals, very colorful and actors where not bad either, I actually empathized with main characters and enjoyed the side stories. However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me."
"I seriously don't know what the hype is all about. Is it because people get killed while playing a game? Is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? Because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better.

To me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long."
"Granted the first episode was well written and performed and SHOCKING!!! Whoo-hooo. But the rest of the show is very simple, predictable and frankly, boring. The hype is over hyped. The memes are just that and the internet bandwagon is full."
"What I liked about it


Very addicting for most of the series. Couldn't let go of it.



Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.



Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before.



The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.



Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.



Just the right amount of gore for my taste.


----

What I didn't like about it


VIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.



Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.



Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.



The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there."
"As a mother, I recommend especially young people to stay away from this series, it is a very harmful series even for an adult with normal psychology, the age group is +18 and the suicidal tendency is increasing in the young people who follow it, if you care about your child, do not allow watch it."
"Maybe the main dude wasn't just so dumb and annoying, half the characters are hard to stand."
"Fantastically haunting soundtrack.

Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.

Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.

This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.

(SPOILER ALERT) X - episode 7 - the VIP's were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.

X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.

X - red hair was pointless X - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.

Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far."
"Games with deaths, friendships, betrayal- we're not new with these stories. The idea of the story is interesting, but not interesting enough to make all these hypes about it. A very overrated and over-hyped show."
"This show's massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show's multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that ""Squid Game"" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. ""Squid Game"" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With ""Squid Game,"" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it."
"First of all, I can't understand why does this show have 8.3 IMBD rating. I am assuming that the audience who have reviewed it are mostly those who haven't watched many series / movies of this genre.

All in all it's s just another series with some Psychopath killing every person who is not able to win / survive a game but with a mix of emotions and drama. If you are thinking that this is a series filled with thrilling chilling moments at every step, you are mistaken. The first episode made me think that this could be a bit different but by the third episode I was wondering why am I even watching it. Every now and then, there will be useless drama, emotional dialogues explaining why each character is playing this game, what their monetary problems are and why they want to get the prize money at any cost. Many useless dialogues and excessive emotional drama that do not make any sense in this kind of series. Side plot stories that lead to nowhere in the end. Lead character is dumb and remains dumb till the end. Acting by the cast is okayish but it deteriorates drastically by the last two episodes. This series is not worth your time. If you like watching psychological thrillers where people get massacred then there are many way better than this like The Collection, Saw Series, Get Out(2017), Final Destination series etc.

But if you want to watch it anyways because of the hype or because of your interest in what the hell these games are, skip to the following timestamps for these episodes and you will be satisfied -


Episode 1: full episode
Episode 2: Ignore. Everyone is just a cry baby. No games in this one.



Episode 3: After 28:00
Episode 4: After 39:58
Episode 5: Till 02:20, no games in this one. Just a dumb side story.



Episode 6: Start at 14:56. This is the most boring one and unfortunately the game takes up the whole episode. Watch this at 1.5x speed.



Episode 7: After 17:57, this has a little bit of thrilling moments
Episode 8: 17:07 to 26, no games but important for the last episode.



Episode 9: first 20 mins."
"The idea is phenomonal, to create some fun for those who have every social and material satisfation within normal human societies and to offer an opportunity for those who are nothing and have nothing within normal human societies. Inspiring extreme setting, but we should be careful that it cannot represent the whole society."
"What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix."
"It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.

Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down."
"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.

There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.

Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):
What are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.



They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:
1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.

2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him) 3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?

Anyways, back to the regular stuff:
The plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?



There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.



Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.



Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?



And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.


There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.

Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous)."
"Ali deserved better and that's all that needs to be said :,("
"First off the main character is unlikeable. I wasn't rooting for him the entire show. He's not exactly a good person and came off as annoying.

Second, it took a LONG TIME for anything interesting to happen. The establishing backstory was very boring and very unnecessary. They could have told us everyone's stories in a couple of quick flashbacks and gone straight into the action!

Third, this is not an original concept. I've seen this type of social commentary done a thousand times in a thousand different ways.

Do yourself a favor and go watch Alice in Borderland. It's a much better show."
"Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.

At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.

Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.

What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.

The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets."
Kim joo & doek su are the ugliest people in this movie!!! The sex scene between the two made me vomit to the point where I had to stop watching the show.
"As many people already said: it's VERY disturbing. And I've seen a lot of disturbing things.

This show will confuse you and will engage you. True emotional rollercoaster. For me - it was brutal. A little too brutal. It was brutal to the point I had to disconnect, sit back, thinking it's just crazy. Sick.

But under all this brutality - incredibly beautiful. As life, as its true beauty you can only appreciate in the context of death. My brain was freaking out. On a subconscious level - I was playing a game. I was barely surviving. I loved and I hated. I was crushed and I was happy.

This show was way too original to ignore. Way too fresh.

Good idea. Many surprises. OK, I guessed 2 plot twists, but still, it was surprising. Not a cliche. Not ""another show"".

Most of the time - completely different experience. Good acting. Interesting characters. Intense action.

Yes, I wanted to unwatch this. But then again, one of the best shows I've ever seen. I think I will never see games (any games) the same again ;)"
"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit ????? But overall excellent great work Netflix."
"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue)."
"How lame it is to copy the trade mark of one of the biggest tv shows. Even those who didn't watch la casa de papel, knows their red suit with the mask. And in 2021 to make a tv show copying the famous costum of an other show... even if it's an extremely well executed show, it is still really emberassing."
"Answer: Do not know. Binged through the 9 episodes .Mixed feelings mixed opinions , mixed reactions, Excessively brutal and violent yet all the brutality and violence hides a hidden agenda for everyone to interpret as he/she wishes. As I watched the English dubbed version with Hebrew subtitles I can only say that the subtitles often differed from the dubbed English ,hence i believe that the translated subtitles are more close to the original Korean version that the dubbing. The main character actors give a reasonable performance while some others should keep their day jobs.

So is it worth watching?-See the Subject line. I would rate it 0/10 and 8/10 at the same time. Hence I am giving it a 4."
"Don't believe the hype.

Don't get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.

I liked it. But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.

It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.

I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.

So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time."
"This tv series is so entertaining. I couldn't switch it off, it hit every emotion from shock, tears and wow.

A must watch if like gripping tv shows."
One of the best shows I have seen in quite some time 10/10 please give us more!! This show is so compelling and emotional and non-stop thrilling suspense!
"An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.

This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.

Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.

While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)

There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.

I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time."
"This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original."
"Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!

BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?"
Believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit Netflix. Every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on. The action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works.
"For me is the best Kdrama in Netflix. So refreshing, thrilled, gore at the same time. Is really mind blowing. 2 thumbs up for this drama!"
"I get the hype around this series, I just don't agree with it.

It's about a game that consists of multiple kids games. If you win one of those games, you go to the next round, but if you lose, you die. The person who wins the last game gets all the money.

The plot is basic and unoriginal. I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I've already seen.

The worst thing about it, is that it's too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die. There were plot twists, but they just didn't surprises me and it wasn't as emotional as people said it was. I haven't shed a single tear, while I normally cry a whole ocean when I watch a simple Disney film.

I'm not saying this is the worst thing ever, maybe it just isn't for me. I don't regret watching it, but I'm not waiting for a second season either."
"Soo, in 2021 you want to make a tv show that will be seen all over the world. And you can do anything, be really creative. BUT, you decide to steal the trade mark of one of the biggest netflix shows of all time.

Even if you didn't see, la casa de papel. You know their red suit and mask.

Why would you do that? Even if the show turns out to be amazing, it's so emberassing. They don't feel ashamed? It's a joke."
Just binge the whole 9 episodes And I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show But the show is still 100%worth If you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you I will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart.
"Idk why there is so much hype about this series. There is only thrill in one episode where they have to cross bridge made of glass. Thats it. No any thrill , slept 3 times between episode 1-4.. restarted again and finished after 4th attempts."
"Best thing I've seen on Netflix in months. The way that the games are set up is what makes this good. I just would rather be shot in the head instead of playing this.... Tug of War and that Glass game is brutal! Almost cried during the Marble game. And the two most irritating players plunged to their death at the same time. I was on my couch cheering!

Check it out."
"It's a breathe of fresh air to see actors not acting like god and stuck in attack-victimise-saviour loops.

But by the 4th episode the main villain (in the game), after being really villainous, is treated like a hero and is given nearly all the screen time. The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...

After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral. The whole story turns into a confused cliche to skip through."
"Over the top acting, drawn out scenes and an awful ending. I watched the first two episodes and there was so much that could have been cut down. Ending up fast forwarding through the rest. Made sure to stop to watch all the contestants licking honeycomb for their life lol. Wouldn't recommend."
"Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean."
"The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off..."
"It is violent, contains plenty of gratuitous blood and gore, and features some amazing set designs and decent performances. Like any good game, Squid Game keeps you hooked until you get to the finishing line. There are a few questionable sub-plots - for instance, the undercover police officer who does absolutely nothing to stop the game - but the overall story holds up. Korean entertainment is here to stay."
Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!
The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.
It's one of the best series I have seen in my life The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show But it still the show is 100% worth watching If you have a good heart I watched it in 1 day.
"In this amazing documentary The World Economic Forum and it's sociopath members have lured ""Climate Change"" deniers and ""vaccine"" hesitant people into a deadly game of life and death. Will the people wake up and unite or are we all doomed to a future under the boot of the worst people on the planet..."
"Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!

Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!

*To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*"
"This series is extremely good, the character I love the most in it have to be player 1. My rating 8/10."
"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men."
"Decent show, good acting and cast, definitely best K-drama I've ever seen, I would probably never rewatch it but it isn't necessarily bad, it is definitely overrated though, I liked the violence and gore, also unlike most K dramas the plot doesn't seem like it was put together in a day and the movie doesn't look like it was filmed by a teenager with an old camera that they found in their basement, also the editing/green screen is a lot better than expected, and most of the actors are hot so they made it easy to watch hahahah.. Also it isn't too long, nor is it too short, which is good because I can't watch things for a prolonged amount of time."
"I have not much to say about it, it would be a waste of time.

Some years ago people read fifty shades of grey thinking it was literature, now they watch this pretending it is cinematography.

They were both made to amuse naives with primitive instincts.

P.s. Do not watch this while eating. Actually do not watch this at all. It's pointless.

Edit : Having been sick with fever and stuck to bed I managed to watch through the whole series. (I guess this was the only way to go through the episodes) Having done so I'll have to change my original 1-star rating to 8-star because some significant points were made later in the series, concerning human nature, which were thought provoking and I actually found interesting. Still believe that it is gross though and not suitable for the faint hearted or those that can't bear the sight of blood or actually any kind of sensitive and/or sensible person. They will feel disgusted. But conclusively I don't regret watching it."
"Loved this show, great story and idea. Though the acting is sub par. And up until the last 2 episodes you really want the main character to die. He was a gambling loser and then at the end he's the only person left that you want to win. Honestly the girl should have won....and then! At the very end...instead of taking his winnings and leaving. He goes back to...Do what? No one knows."
"The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like ""Squid Game"" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.

A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don't want to spoil the series, I think it's more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.

To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it's unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that's where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, ""Squid Game"" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take ""The Platform"" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. ""The Platform"" doesn't dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn't matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our's and the movie's reality. Then how does ""The Platform"" differ from ""Squid Game""? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in ""Squid Game"". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.

That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn't go the authors' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn't know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.

The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.

As a metaphor, ""Squid Game"" could've worked not unlike the aforementioned ""The Platform"", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.

As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as ""Alice in Borderland"". The realism wouldn't matter then and the mystery would be stronger.

As a realistic show we would have something like ""Saló or 120 days of Sodom"". And it should've felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn't seem the point ""Squid Game"" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, ""Squid Game"" doesn't confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with ""Funny Games"". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don't worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question."
"I am not one to follow the hype train usually but I just finished watching this and I have to say if you haven't seen this one then you're missing out! The way it grips you from the very start and doesn't let go is something to be applauded. Without spoiling anything all I can talk about is how the show made me feel... it is brutal and I am not talking about the violence. Part psychological drama, part social commentary and filled with twists and turns this one is not one to miss!"
"I cannot, for the love of God, imagine why this became so popular.

1. The acting is atrocious. Super over the top, absolutely unbelievable, cringeworthy at best.

2. The main character has hardly any character development and is difficult to identify with (also due to very very poor acting).

3. The plot is super predictable and sometimes completely lacks logic (like with the policeman). If you think this is original watch ""Oldboy"" or ""Battle Royale"", ""Saw"" or ""Hunger games"" for pointless violence. These movies were made 20 years ago and, even though they are not good imo, they are far better than Squid game.

4. The whole game is pointless and hard to understand. The reason why certain characters behave in a certain way is random and not at all explained. The scenario is lousy and dialogues are laughable.

There is literally nothing good about this series. Waste of time. If you want something similar on Netflix from Korea then watch ""Hellbound"". It is leagues better than ""Squid game"" as it has good acting, a surprisingly deep story and a lot of realism in spite of the CGI and fantasy elements."
"OUTSTANDING...

Well after knowing about the hype I decided to watch it on weekend and now I am empty, speechless.

The performance from main lead was so satisfying and real, the concept was creative and allow imagination, this is what we called perfect mind-boggling cinema and episode 6 will going to stay there for a long long time.... Must watch...."
"I knew this will be amazing on first look of it, I watched it as soon as it got out on netflix, it is briliant and it deseves all love that is getting."
"It was a very bad series. In fact, it was an incomplete and dirty copy of Kaiji anime. This series had a lot of story holes. The story structure took on the dark aspects of Darwinism but could not show the consequences. Director By putting on pleasant music, tries to make the audience sympathize with a psychic killer who has killed many people. The series is very immoral and is not recommended at all because it portrays humans as animals without any consequences for this. I also do not understand the director's opposition to religion and God. As if he just wanted to attract the attention of big companies. I suggest you watch Kaiji anime because it is really a masterpiece. ."
"I don't really understand the point of the cop subplot... Otherwise I had a blast watching this show, loved the cinematography, and the main actor is great."
"I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)

The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.

The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn't really serve any purpose either.

All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn't as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn't a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing."
"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.

The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.

Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough."
Terefic irrelevent boring irritating i am watching this show from last 12 days and finally today i end this series genrally i play vedios on normal speed but for this i want 2x to 4x speed and finally i completed this show with infinite suffering thanks to my patience level one last thing i goona say about this web is increase my patience level.
This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.
"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.

This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.

I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.

All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.

This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it."
"Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.

The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.

But definitely watch it."
"This is the best thriller which I have seen till now.

Vera level entertainment

Starting to end full entertainment and suspense.

Netflix proves its best.

Waiting for next season."
"Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.

This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life: I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!"
"I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced. It was definitely a great series. The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise."
"The games and story is a crazy one. Surprised they pulled this off during covid but of course it's korean drama. They are at the top of their game. Very gorey, heads up."
I don't get why people love it. Simply put it's saw but these people are willing to risk death. The over acting is annoying and not sure what the actual words are but the English dub is painful and out of touch with what is going on in the movie.
Terrible voice actor in the main character. Childish. Stopped watching. Subtitles are better.
"Curiosity got the best of us and we decided to give it a try and see what the general craze is all about. Watched it to the end, at some point just to get it over with, although it's pretty predictable, most of the actors are talentless and some almost deplorable. Voice over in English kind of helped a little - I don't think we could have watched it in Korean. Those who read Richard Bachman's ""Running man"" (Stephen King's alias) may have recognized the general idea of a deadly game played by desperate paupers in a distopian society - so nothing new here, right? However, Bachman's characters are likable, relatable and dignified in spite of their humility. Squid game's characters are greedy, vicious, non relatable and it's really hard to make a connection with them or feel anything - viewer sees them just like the glass chess-like pieces in one of the last games. Being unable to identify the characters by name doesn't help either. I won't even get into details about the level of violence - gory and unnecessary. So, why the craze? Beats me."
"Top everything, go watch it, no seriously, this show was it for me.

10/10."
"After having seen it, i must say i wasn't quite expecting it to be like this. I expected something savage & stupid like the Hunger Games movies. But this is much more intelligent, emotional & psychological. What starts off as a competition to survive the games gets emotionally disturbing & traumatizing half-way through. It makes you question morals & the dark side of humanity.

Please don't watch this show if you're already depressed or going through a sad period in your life, as this show might negatively affect your mental health. There is too much sadness & grimness in this show.

If you want to watch something dark, intelligent & original, this is a must watch."
"It's an okay series, but I really don't think it's hypeworthy. Most, if not all, elements of the series have been there before, but better. Only distinguishing feature is that it's korean.

What really bothered me was: Overacting a lot of times. Or is that just a cultural thing?

Cringeworthy dialogues from all people involved (especially the bad guys).

Certain storylines just fizzle out into nothingness. What's the purpose of having them then?"
"I have an account for 10 years on IMDB but it will be my first review. I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.

This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wasted

The show is only saved by the great acting.

Never again."
This is an Over acted and stupid show. You just don't care about the characters and it's all over the place. Also this is a re ash of so many other movies and nothing original. Finally the English translation voice over is just horrible.
I'm on episode 5 and I'm considering giving up on the show. It's obviously not my cup of tea but I can't see how this many people like it. It's mediocre at best. I especially hate the character interaction. It's so unrealistic. There are many plot holes already.
"My goodness...this show brilliantly took me down a path of horrors. Each episode digging deeper into terrible situations. And just when you think things can't get much worse, they do. But I loved nearly every second of it. Warning: One of the episodes definitely gave my girlfriend an anxiety attack."
"This is so overhyped its untrue. 4/10

Here's the reality, without spoilers (not that there us that much to spoil). This is just so derivative of other series, be they far eastern or western and so there really was very little original to talk about. Its basically just a gore fest with the excuse that its an anti capitalist message... yawn, done before and far better in many other productions. I really dont get what others are seeing that is original about it.

This inevitably leads to there being something else needed to pull through and that typically means great characters or great effects. Sadly this really fails on the latter and doesnt really deliver on the former either,I have no issues with anti heros but if you have a full cast of them, then you've really gotta work saving graces in. There were ok, a couple of characters that werent completely abhorrent.

I didnt find the acting particularly convincing from any of them, completely overdramatized interactions were the norm. That however could be as much the direction as the actor/actress.

Also dont get me started on the sexism etc in this. I get annoyed at Holywood for the long term fad of trying to remove any masculinity from all things to the point of absurdity but that doesn't excuse things in the other direction, the chauvinism not just expressed by characters (which would be ok to a certain degree) but then underpinned by events in the show is just unacceptable and cost this show 2 stars in and if itself.

Overall, I watched it through just to see where it went and it just remained pretty poor. I doubt I will bother with season 2, whatever the hype."
"Story
the game and the story of the main character is excellent but the ending is the only thing that made me give it 9, not 10 but the show is worth watching ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Characters
The preforms are great and the writing of the characters are amazing ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra
Soundtracks are unique.

This Is Wonderful and Best Webseries Forever. It has Also Season 2. It is available on all Languages. This Type of webseries Never before Ever after. It has Mind Blocking Twists.
"Extremely enjoyable. I believe it deserves its high rating. It invokes a lot of emotion and keeps you wanting more. Many life lessons to be learnt especially about trust. It reminds me if why the saying money is the root of all evil, and we see how betrayal even in the most unlikely people is caused by money and its possibilities to solved our life's financial difficulties.... A must watch. Korean thrillers and horrors are truly enjoyable."
"I'll give this series a high 6. A lot of clichés and familiar tropes collide here. I would definitely watch another series if it were offered though, as there are many avenues for this to go. If you're young, or don't watch a lot of movies/series, the hype is for you. Enjoy."
"Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!"
"It is not a bad series, but the hype around them is a joke... Money Heist or Alice in Borderland a million times better.

This is only exciting for those who haven't seen a single movie in the last 20 years.

I give them 1 star to ballance the hype, but its actually a 6-7 star thing, but the hype is too big, so for the justice i must to give them 1 star."
"What's with all the hype??

My biggest problem with this are the characters. I just don't care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn.

The concept is nothing ground breaking. Seen it done before and better. Also don't bother with the dubbed audio, you'll end up laughing.

Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also.

Overall, I just didn't care, not the worst thing I've ever seen but nowhere's near worthy of the hype it received."
This is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. Don't want just waste of time.
I only started watching this show after hearing / reading how good it supposedly is and I made it to episode 4 and gave up. I really didn't enjoy this at all and found it silly and boring. I won't be watching any more of it.
"A new addition to the ""battle royale"" genre, Squid Game adds a refreshing take.

The situations in which the characters find themselves is heart-rending drama. I've seen some reviews claim that the show attempts to legitimize the shock value violence by hiding behind a poor veil of human interest/sociology 101, but I honestly find the show gripping, and I finished with genuine interest in the characters portrayed.

Be forewarned - it is violent and at times difficult to watch, but if you can get past that, you'll find a gem."
"What is wrong with the world? Lol this show is horrible and predictable but mostly stupid.

Episode 2, they all go home... those that survived. Then they go back, willingly and I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Oh, my they are so broke that they'll go enter games to kill themselves for money that if they die they don't get so they leave their family without answers to even where they've gone. Now their family will spend a lifetime looking for them.

That's selfish.

I think people today are easily entertained. The thought of being so stupid so play chilhood games in a deadly way for money is insane. Oh and it was obvious #1 was in on it... he was far too happy playing a Red Light and definitely moved lol.

I'm in awe, seriously."
STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.
"Battle Royale made the path so I can't give the 10 stars because that movie paved the way for this show.

If you don't like thrillers sparkled with a bit of gore, you'd better pass, otherwise you're in for a great ride.

It is very dark, the character development is well made. In 9 episodes you get attached to them.

Don't listen to the people discussing the violence, you see worse in Hollywood but without the psychological scenario.

There were plenty left for explanation but not in a frustrating way. More of I let the viewer decide. Great addition to the Netflic catalog allover."
"I had a problem to stay with the show in multiple episodes where the tempo suddenly changes and it becomes rather uneventful, predictable and boring. I know, it tries to bring in some emotional moments (sometimes successfully ).

Korean acting style is often over the top, but in this series it fits in as it should bring out the stressful environment. Still, sometimes annoying.

Overall I liked it, but mostly I just wanted to know what happens next regardless of the actors or performances. Events in the plot are more significant than anything else. I am glad I avoided any spoilers before watching this, otherwise I think I would just quit mid episode 1."
"An excellent series on the critique of capitalism and money worship in the world and the current world of Korea (South). The series clearly challenges capitalist society, saying that the poor (participants here) are the slaves of the rich (here the game makers). As the main character clearly says somewhere: ""You (the poor) bet on the horses and we (the rich) bet on you! You are our horses! The main goal of the series is the critique of capitalism in the form of these."" Fascinating, exciting and breathtaking matches that managed to reach their goal well and become the most watched series in the history of Netflix to date, which is true, I suggest you watch it."
"Great show with surprising end but with the fear of a second, everything destroying second season due to the open last part of the show."
"This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!"
